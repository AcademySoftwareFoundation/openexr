Version 1.0.1:
	* Removed Windows .suo files from distribution.
	  (Eric Wimmer)

Version 1.0.0:
	* Bumped DSO version number to 6.0
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* Rounding during float-to-half conversion now implements
	  "round to nearest even" mode: if the original float value
	  is exactly in the middle between the two closest half values
	  then rounding chooses the half value whose least significant
	  bit is zero.
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* Installation Tuning:
	  - Corrected version number on dso's (libtool) - now 5.0
	  - Separated ILMBASE_LDFLAGS and ILMBASE_LIBS so that test programs
	    in configure scripts of packages dependent on IlmBase can link
	    with static libraries properly
	  - eliminated some warning messages during install
	  (Andrew Kunz)

	* Initial release of this code as a separate library.
	  Previously the libraries contained were part of
	  version 1.4.0 of OpenEXR
	* New build scripts for Linux/Unix
	  (Andrew Kunz)
	* New Windows project files and build scripts
	  (Kimball Thurston)
