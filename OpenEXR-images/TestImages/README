This directory contains a few OpenEXR files with unusual numbers
in their pixels.  The files can be used to test how application
programs behave when they encounter pixels with very small, very
large or non-finite pixel values:


WideColorGamut.exr

    Some pixels in this RGB image have extremely saturated colors,
    outside the gamut that can be displayed on a video monitor whose
    primaries match Rec. ITU-R BT.709.  All RGB triples in the image
    correspond to CIE xyY triples with xy chromaticities that represent
    real colors.  (In a chromaticity diagram, the pixels are all inside
    the spectral locus.) For pixels whose chromaticities are outside
    the triangle defined by the chromaticities of the Rec. 709
    primaries, at least one of the RGB values is negative.


AllHalfValues.exr

    The pixels in this RGB HALF image contain all 65,536 possible
    16-bit floating-point numbers, including positive and negative
    numbers, normalized and denormalized numbers, zero, NaNs,
    positive infinity and negative infinity.


WideFloatRange.exr

    This image contains only a single G channel of type FLOAT.
    The values in the pixels span almost the entire range of
    possible 32-bit floating-point numbers (roughly -1e38 to +1e38).
