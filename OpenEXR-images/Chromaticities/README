This directory contains four OpenEXR files that can be used
to test if a program that displays images handles the files'
chromaticities attribute correctly.

Displayed properly, all four images should look the same.

Rec709.exr	R, G, B channels with chromaticities according
		to Rec. ITU-R BT.709-3

Rec709_YC.exr	Luminance/chroma encoded image, generated
		from R, G, B channels with chromaticities
		according to Rec. ITU-R BT.709-3

XYZ.exr		R, G, B channels with chromaticities such
		that R, G and B correspond to CIE X, Y and Z

XYZ_YC.exr	Luminance/chroma encoded image, generated
		from R, G, B channels with chromaticities
		such that R, G and B correspond to CIE X,
		Y and Z
