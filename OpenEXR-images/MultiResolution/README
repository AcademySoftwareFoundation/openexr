This directory contains various multi-resolution OpenEXR images

Regular images:

    Bonita.exr		

	Point Bonita in the Marin Headlands, California (mip-map).

    Kapaa.exr

	Near Kapa'a, Kaua'i, Hawai'i (rip-map).

Environment maps:

    KernerEnvCube.exr
    KernerEnvLatLong.exr

	Parking lot on Kerner Blvd., San Rafael, California
	(mip-map, in cube-face and latitude-longitude format).

    StageEnvCube.exr
    StageEnvLatLong.exr

	Stage with props, cameras and other equipment (mip-map,
	in cube-face and latitude-longitude format).

Test images:

    ColorCodedLevels.exr
    
	A mip-map checkerboard image where each resolution level
	has a different color.  If this image is used to texture
	an object during 3D rendering, then the color of the object
	shows which resolution levels are accessed by the renderer
	as it projects the texture onto the object.

    PeriodicPattern.exr	
    MirrorPattern.exr	
    
	Mip-map images that tile seamlessly in "periodic" and
	"mirror" wrap mode respectively.  The images can be used to
	check if 3D renderers correctly implement those wrap modes.

    OrientationCube.exr
    OrientationLatLong.exr
    
	An environment map, in cube-face and in latitude-longitude
	format, that indicates the directions of the environment's
	x, y and z axes.

    WavyLinesCube.exr
    WavyLinesLatLong.exr
    
	An environment map, in cube-face and in latitude-longitude 
	format, that can be used to test how an application program,
	for example, a 3D renderer, handles the seams of environment
	maps.

	The environment image contains multiple sets of wavy lines.
	Each set consists of three parallel lines of equal width.
	Parts of the middle line run along one of the map's seams,
	crossing back and forth over the seam.  (In a cube-face map
	seams occur along the edges of the six faces of the cube.
	In a latitude-longitude map, there is a seam along the
	meridian with longitude +/-pi.)

	If the environment map is correctly projected onto a sphere,
	then the seams should be invisible, and all lines should
	appear to have the same uniform width everywhere.  It should
	be impossible or at least difficult to tell where the middle
	line in each set crosses one of the map's seams.

	File WavyLinesSphere.exr shows what this environment map
	should look like when has been correctly projected onto
	a sphere.  (In this image the environment sphere is seen
	from the outside, not from the inside).
