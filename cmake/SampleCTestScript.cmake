# and also use a cdash (or cdash compliant) results server.

# There are also settings in the CMakeLists.txt you may wish to

# Running ctest -S thisscript.cmake will build into the binary directory
# and run a few different tests based on what commands are specified
# (and the steps below). It is best to read the ctest docs to
# understand all these settings, and how to control it, this is merely
# provided as a sample

# system, and putting O.S. / configuration specific control to this file
# instead of having to put it into the make CMakeLists.txt tree
# somehow.

# environment variable from the CI system, but you are free to have
# any path in here
