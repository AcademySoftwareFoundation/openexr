# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you've found a potential vulnerability in OpenEXR, please
report it by emailing security@openexr.com. Only TSC members and ASWF
project management have access to these messages. Include detailed
steps to reproduce the issue, and any other information that could aid
an investigation. Our policy is to respond to vulernability reports
within 14 days.

Our policy is to address critical security vulnerabilities rapidly and
post patches as quickly as possible.

See the [release notes](CHANGES.md) for a listing of known CVEs and
the releases in which they have been addressed.
