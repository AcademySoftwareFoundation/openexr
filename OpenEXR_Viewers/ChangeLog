	* Added "look modification transform" support to playexr, exrdisplay.
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* Installation Tuning:
	  - corrected version number on dso's (libtool) - now 5.0
	  - Separated ILMBASE_LDFLAGS and ILMBASE_LIBS so that test programs
	    can link with static libraries properly
	  - eliminated some warning messages during install
	  (Andrew Kunz)

	  Previously the exrdisplay contained in this package
