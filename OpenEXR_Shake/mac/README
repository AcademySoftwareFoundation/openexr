This project will look for the OpenEXR headers and libraries
in /usr/local, which is the default installation location.

Shake plugins for OS X currently must be compiled with gcc 3.1.  
This means that you have to build the EXR libraries with gcc 3.1
as well.  The easiest way to do this is to start from a fresh
install of OpenEXR, and execute these commands:

% cd OpenEXR
% sudo gcc_select 3.1
% ./bootstrap
% ./configure --enable-shared=no --enable-osx-istream-hack
% make
% sudo make install

After you've done this, you can build the Xcode project which
will build the Shake plugin.  Note that this will statically
link the OpenEXR libraries into the plugin, so you won't
have to install the specially built libraries on every machine.

If you don't specify --enable-shared=no, the shake plugin will
be dynamically linked to the OpenEXR libraries, and will not
function on a machine without these libraries installed.  If
you know of a way to force Xcode to link to the static libraries
even if the dynamic libraries exist, please let us know.

To make sure that you haven't linked to the OpenEXR libraries
dynamically, you can use the "otool" command, which will list
all dynamic libraries that a bundle is linked to.  For example:

% cd OpenEXR_Shake/mac/build/exrFormat.bundle/Contents/MacOS
% otool -L exrFormat

Note that this plugin is dynamically linked to the Carbon framework, 
libz (the compression library), libSystem, and the various Shake 
frameworks.  If you see the OpenEXR libraries in this list, your
plugin will not work on systems without those libraries installed.
