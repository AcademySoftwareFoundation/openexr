This project will look for the OpenEXR headers and libraries
in /usr/local, which is the default installation location.

Shake plugins for OS X currently must be compiled with gcc 3.1.  
This means that you have to build the EXR libraries with gcc 3.1
as well.  The easiest way to do this is to start from a fresh
install of OpenEXR, and execute these commands:

% cd OpenEXR
% sudo gcc_select 3.1
% ./bootstrap
% ./configure --enable-shared=no --enable-osx-istream-hack
% make
% sudo make install

After you've done this, you can build the Xcode project which
will build the Shake plugin.  Note that this will statically
link the OpenEXR libraries into the plugin, so you won't
have to install the specially built plugins on every machine.
