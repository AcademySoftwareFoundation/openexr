# OpenEXR Project Governance

The OpenEXR project is owned by the Academy Software Foundation and is
governed by its Committers, including a Technical Steering Committee
(TSC) which is responsible for high-level guidance of the project.

## Contributors

The OpenEXR project grows and thrives from assistance from Contributors.
Contributors include anyone in the community that contributes code,
documentation, or other technical artifacts that have been incorporated into the
projects repository.

## Committers

The OpenEXR GitHub repository is maintained by OpenEXR Committers. Committers
are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify source code,
documentation, or other technical artifacts to the project. Upon becoming
Committers, they become members of the OpenEXR leadership team.

Their privileges include, but are not limited to:

* Commit access to the OpenEXR repository
* Moderator status on all communication channels

### Committer Activities

Typical activities of a Committer include:

* Helping users and novice contributors
* Ensuring a response to questions posted to the openexr-dev alias
* Contributing code and documentation changes that improve the project
* Reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests
* Participation in working groups
* Merging pull requests

The TSC periodically reviews the Committer list to identify inactive Committers.
Past Committers are typically given Emeritus status. Emeriti may request that
the TSC restore them to active Committer status.

### Committer Nominations

Any existing Committer can nominate an individual making significant and
valuable contributions to the OpenEXR project to become a new Committer.

To nominate a new Committer, open an issue in the OpenEXR repository, with a
summary of the nominee's contributions.

If there are no objections raised by any Committers two weeks after the issue is
opened, the nomination will be considered as accepted. Should there be any
objections against the nomination, the TSC is responsible for working with the
individuals involved and finding a resolution. The nomination must be approved
by the TSC, which is assumed when there are no objections from any TSC members.

Prior to the public nomination, the Committer initiating it may seek feedback
from other Committers in private channels and work with the nominee to improve
the nominee's contribution profile, in order to make the nomination as
frictionless as possible.

If individuals making valuable contributions do not believe they have been
considered for a nomination, they may log an issue or contact a Committer
directly.

## Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) oversees the overall technical
direction of OpenEXR, as defined in the project
[charter](ASWF/charter/OpenEXR-Technical-Charter.md).  This
charter defines the TSC member terms and succession policies.

The responsibilities of the TSC include:

* Coordinating technical direction of the Project
* Project governance and process (including this policy)
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting
* Conduct guidelines
* Maintaining the list of additional Committers
* Appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards
communities
* Discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical
matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects
* Coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the project

The TSC elects a Chair person, who acts as the project manager, organizing meetings and
providing oversight to project administration. The Chair is elected by the TSC.
The Chair also serves as the OpenEXR representative on the Academy Software Foundation (ASWF) Technical
Advisory Council (TAC). The chair represents the
project at all ASWF TAC meetings.

### TSC Leaders

* Chair: Cary Phillips

### TSC Members

* Cary Phillips - Industrial Light & Magic
* Rod Bogart - Epic Games
* Larry Gritz - Sony Pictures ImageWorks
* Peter Hillman - Weta Digital, Ltd.
* Kimball Thurston - Weta Digital, Ltd.
* Nick Porcino - Oculus
* Christina Templaar-Leitz - Epic Games
* John Mertic - The Linux Foundation

### TSC Meetings

All meetings of the TSC are open to participation by any member of the
OpenEXR community. Meeting times are listed in the [ASWF technical
community calendar](https://lists.aswf.io/g/tac/calendar), currently
each Thursday at 1pm Pacific Time via Zoom video conference.  The TSC
Chair moderates the meeting, or appoints another TSC member to
moderate in his or her absence.

Items are added to the TSC agenda which are considered contentious or are
modifications of governance, contribution policy, TSC membership, or release
process, in addition to topics involving the high-level technical direction of
the project.

The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches. That should
happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger group of Committers.

Any community member or Contributor can ask that something be reviewed
by the TSC at the meeting by logging a GitHub issue. Any Committer,
TSC member, or the meeting chair can bring the issue to the TSC's
attention by applying the `tsc-review` label.

Prior to each TSC meeting, the meeting chair will share the agenda with members
of the TSC. TSC members can also add items to the agenda at the beginning of
each meeting. The meeting chair and the TSC cannot veto or remove items.

The TSC may invite additional persons to participate in a non-voting capacity.

The meeting chair is responsible for archiving the minutes, stored at 
https://github.com/openexr/openexr/tree/master/ASWF/tsc-meetings.

Due to the challenges of scheduling a global meeting with participants in
several time zones, the TSC will seek to resolve as many agenda items as
possible outside of meetings on the public mailing list.

### TSC Nomination

Any proposal for additional members of the TSC may be submitted by Committers
and/or TSC members by opening an issue outlining their case. Formal consensus
should be reached by the existing TSC members. No objections raised by any TSC
members two weeks after the issue is opened does not imply acceptance, if
general consensus cannot be reached by this time a formal vote is required.

Should there be any objections against the nomination, the TSC is responsible
for working with the individuals involved and finding a resolution.

### TSC Succession

A voting member of the TSC may nominate a successor in the event that such
voting member decides to leave the TSC, and the TSC, including the departing
member, shall confirm or reject such nomination by a vote.

In the event that the departing member’s nomination for successor is rejected by
vote of the TSC, the departing member shall be entitled to continue nominating
successors until one such successor is confirmed by vote of the TSC. If the
departing member fails or is unable to nominate a successor, the TSC may
nominate one on the departing member’s behalf.
