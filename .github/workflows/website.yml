# Run only on changes in the "website" directory or workflow file.
# Skip the release branches, since the website is built from main.
#
# Readthedocs builds the website on ubuntu-20.04, so technically
# that's the only system that requires the website to build properly,
# but developers contributing to the website may work on Windows or
# macOS, so this confirms that it builds properly there, too.
#
# Note that this does not build the OpenEXR libraries, it only runs
# doxygen and sphinx to generate the website html.
