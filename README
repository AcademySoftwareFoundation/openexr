// Developer Preview
//


The code is part of the developer preview release. 
It is *NOT* production ready, in particular:

- File format may change:
  Whilst all due care and attention has been given to ensuring the file
  format be robust, there is a chance that during testing periods
  necessary modifications will be introduced.

- API may change:
  We don't anticipate any client level API changes, however, there may 
  cases where said modifications may be necessary. 

Any such changes will be communicated to the developer list with advance
warning.

The code should build on most flavours of *nix, including OSX and Linux. 

Currently support for the Windows platform is limited. However, this
distribution includes files necessary to build static libraries using the
CMake system. 

Feedback and contributions are most welcome.

// OpenEXR
//


OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by 
Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer imaging applications.

OpenEXR is used by ILM on all motion pictures currently in production. 
The first movies to employ OpenEXR were Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, 
Men in Black II, Gangs of New York, and Signs. Since then, OpenEXR has become 
ILM's main image file format.

OpenEXR's features include:

    * Higher dynamic range and color precision than existing 8- and 10-bit 
      image file formats.
    * Support for 16-bit floating-point, 32-bit floating-point, and 
      32-bit integer pixels. The 16-bit floating-point format, called "half", 
      is compatible with the half data type in NVIDIA's Cg graphics language 
      and is supported natively on their new GeForce FX and Quadro FX 3D 
      graphics solutions.
    * Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the included 
      codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on images with film 
      grain.
    * Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily be added
      by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR software distribution.
      New image attributes (strings, vectors, integers, etc.) can be added to 
      OpenEXR image headers without affecting backward compatibility with 
      existing OpenEXR applications. 
    * Support for sterescopic image workflows and a generalisation to 
      multi-views.
    * Flexible support for deep data for hard surfaces and volumetric data.
    * Multipart. Ability to encode multiple images in one file. This allows
      for seeks to individual parts without accessing other parts of the file.
    * Versioning. v2 of the OpenEXR source makes use of user configurable C++
      namespaces to provide protection when using multiple versions of the
      library.
      
ILM has released OpenEXR as free software licensed under the modified BSD 
license.

The distribution is divided into the following sub-modules:
    * IlmBase
    * OpenEXR
    * OpenEXR_Viewers
    * Photoshop
    * d_exr
    
Please see the README files of each of the individual directories for more
information.
