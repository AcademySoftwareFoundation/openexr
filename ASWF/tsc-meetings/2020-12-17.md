### Discussion:

* Wave: Lead of ASWF Assets working group

  * Example question we're dealing with: “How can we get a bunch of
    USD asets with MaterialX materials?”

  * Instead, why don’t we approach the projects and ask them what they
    would want, in the space that they care about?

  * At Apple we have some example EXR's we're trying to get clearance
    to send, mostly illustrating bugs.
  
  * Larry: We already have openexr-images, covers the basic.

  * Two examples that frequently come up with OIIO:

    * Test cases for all crazy things with metadata, range of data formats.

    * openexr-images has a couple of deep images, but they’re very
      simple caes, they aren’t indicative. We need hairy production
      images that would, say, confirm an application isn't going to
      run out of memory.

  * Kimball: could generate some AOV’s from the Moana scene.

  * Wave: Could we hire an intern to generate images from Moana?

  * Kimball: We don’t have a good version history. But then, backwards
    compatibility isn't that much of an issues, since we don't change
    the file format very often.
  
  * Wave: "Would like to be able to say there are 17 AOV’s in that
    image." Larry: "I'd would pay so much for anyone at my studio to
    use less than 50!"
  
  * Cary: maybe the project CII badge should include entries for
    example data. Project should be encouraged to provide
    representative example data.
  
  * Larry: OSL has a huge shader library, but everything’s
    interconnected, nothing public that is representatives of
    production use.
  
  * New features added to the library need corresponding test images.
  
  * Joseph: None of the compression methods are documented. Could we
    get an intern to document them? Not a Google Summer of Code
    intern, the project have to involve actual code. But it would be
    good to get it standardized.
  
  * Joseph: Maybe the Academy Sci-Tech intern? Speak to Alex
    Forstythe, there have been some great interns with the Academy.

* Robin Lowe: I’m participating in the discussions on the 16-bit float
  type with the C++ standards committee.

  * The C++ proposal is still active.

  * One of the key differences with 16 bit floats is how they do
    rounding.  C++ allows for severa kinds of rounding. OpenEXR only
    does one. We don’t allow the other kinds of rounding.
  
  * Whatever is in hardware is going to be stamped into standards.

  * Joseph: compatibility with existing code, will it be a templated type?

  * Robin: standard type should be the native type on the
    hardware. Or, these are three separate things.

  * OpenEXR is largely compatible with the Nvidia type.
  
  * Could typedef half to fp16.

  * “Call it half”, be done.


* Continue C++11 support? 


  * Cary: ILM still has code that needs that requires C++11.

  * Kimball: So does Weta.

  * Larry: Then that's it, we maintain compatibility with C++11 for now.


* Imath PR #72: Eliminate normalize and length methods for Vec<inttype>

  * Cary: I recommend dropping the wonky integer methods. Better to
    have missing functions that functions that do weird things.

  * Larry: This is a part of the bigger thing of trying to put
    noexcept on everything. The integer methods throw exceptions, even
    the ones that aren't supposed to.
