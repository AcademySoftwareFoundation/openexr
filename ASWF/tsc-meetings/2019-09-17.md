### Discussion

* Beta v2.4.0-beta.1 is ready for official release.

* Next up:
 
  * finish off the CII best practices badge.

  * fix sonar bugs

  * request updates to mitre.org CVE entries.

  * Still waiting on Lucasfilm Business Affairs to configure EasyCLA;
    repo move is blocked until that happens.

  * Start port of PyImath to pybind11, which is going to be a lot of work.

  * clang-format (not to be confused with clang-tidy, which is
    different) - Larry has a setup on OIIO that runs clang-format on
    PR, rejects if the formatting is off but also posts a diff, so the
    submitter can get the formatting right even if they don't have
    clang installed.

* CVE's: 

  * CVE-2016-4629 and CVE-2016-4629 were fixed by Apple in the OS.
  
  * CVE-2006-2277 - the link on the mitre.org page is broken, but the
    offending .exr is available on the internet archive wayback
    machine here:
    https://web.archive.org/web/20060520062054/http://w148.de/~cmertes/nachbarhaus1.exr

* Christina gives an overview of SonarCloud set-up. Read the YAML
  documentation here:
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&tabs=schema

* Joseph: We should reach out to distro packagers and
  request/encourage/help them to update to the new release.
