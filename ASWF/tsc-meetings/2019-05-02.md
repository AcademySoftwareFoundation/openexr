### Discussion:

* John: We are the Technical Steering Committee:

  * Issues, questions, 
  * Serves the community, not necessarily an overlord.
  * Has the help of the TAC

* Need to set up a TSC subdirectory in the github repo, to hold meeting notes, etc.

* There are three github repos:
  - Openexr
  - Openexr-website
  - Openexr-images (big test images, nice to not pollute the main repo with them)

  - Kimball Thurston - Weta
  - Nick Rasmussen - ILM
  - Nick Porcino - Occulus, formerly ILM 
  - Jonathan Stone - Lucasfilm/MaterialX

* ASWF member organization have obligation to contribute to projects.

* Larry: OCIO has a separate role for TSC chair. We can be creative with how we divide the roles. Few things come to formal votes.

* Cary elected TSC chair

* Action items:
  - Set up aswf.io mailing lists; send message asking recipients to sign up over there; this lets us know who the community is.
  - Set up private TSC alias.
  - Move github repo to ASWF (contents will be unchanged, address will not change)
  - John: contact Steve Winslow about code scanning, make sure license compliance in order.  
  - Cary: Add permissions to github repos
