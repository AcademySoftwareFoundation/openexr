### Discussion:

* nvcc 10.1 errors on the detector templates in ImathTypeTraits.h. Not
  sure what's going on, but #if-ing them out is sufficient.

* Get final changes in for the 3.0 release over the weekend, then cut
  a new beta release, say, Monday. Then let it sit unchanged for
  several days until April 1, when that exact code becomes the
  release.

* We need better coordination with the VES committee regarding release
  schedules and vendor demands.

* ImfAttribute symbol warnings: not propagating a setting? Export is
  stubbed out for Windows, that may be the issue. Nick will investigate.

* Setting the tag on Imath that openexr pulls to build. Once Imath 3.0
  is officially released, set the RB-3.0 branch of OpenEXR to pull
  from that. But leave openexr/master pulling from Imath/master. That
  way, we have some CI pulling on the master branch from another repo.

* CLA status: Weta and Epic still in progress.

* "Release” branch: The goal is that the thing called "release" is
  always the latest. Have a branch called "release" and update it to
  point to the release tag after a release. It's not a branch to merge
  into, and doesn't have to be fast-forwarded, just set to the proper
  commit.

* Release notes technique: Larry: I heavily edit.

* Windows Deadlocking: NickP says it's the hopper, haven’t
  forgotten. The person who submitted gave a minimal repo case. It’s
  on shutdown. Intermittent and only on Windows. Deadlocks on
  shutdown. Possible solution: dllmain? Some users wish OpenEXR didn't
  have custom threadpool, just use TBB.
  
* Some users keep long-lived cmake caches. We’ve baked the namespaces
  into cmake variables but namespaces update on every minor release.
  Should the default be a empty string, require setting?

  * Larry: the build/install instructions should be: “Start with 'rm
    build'” so there's no chance old cmake caches mess up the build
    for users who aren't cmake experts.
  
  * And CMake 3.13 has -S/-B options: cmake -B my/build/dir -S my/src/dir

* gh command line tool is your friend. https://cli.github.com/
