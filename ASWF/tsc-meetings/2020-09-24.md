* Owen Thompson

### Discussion:

* Joseph raised the issue of "Standard Optional Attributes", should
  the be added to the reference implementation?  We raised the issue
  around SIGGRAPH and Open Source Days but got no feedback. How do we
  get feedback from the community?  Suggestion: Just send it to Josh
  Pines, John Cortell, and the usual suspects at major facilities.

* The attributes don’t affect the image, they just help with
  interpeting the data.

* Peter: put an image in the openexr-images repo that illustrates the
  new attributes, so it gives people an opportunity to actually see
  what it would look like.

* Rod: We have been working on an optimization about reading really
  big exrs as fast as possible.  At 8Kx4K, we can get about 3 per
  second. Tried memory mapping, got to 5/sec.  Structured buffer on
  the GPU, using GPU to decoded the data got to 18/sec. But it’s
  specific to particular EXR. Is this something we should consider
  supporting at the library level?

* Rod: one option is use something other than EXR. Please say no.
