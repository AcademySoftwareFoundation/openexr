In order to make the Mac build compatible with all CVS servers and clients, the Macintosh-specificresources (such as dialogs) have been stored in Rez format.  If you would like to edit these resourcesin an editor such as Resourcerer, you must firstcompile the .r file into a file with a validresource fork.  There are several ways to do this:one way is to use the command line tools that shipwith Apple's Developer Tools.In Terminal:prompt% cd OpenEXR/Photoshop/mac/rsrcprompt% /Developer/Tools/Rez ADMDialogs.r -o ADMDialogs.rsrcThis will create a file, ADMDialogs.rsrc, which can be openedin a resource editor.  You can replace ADMDialogs.r with thisfile in the CodeWarrior project.  However, if you wish to submit any changes you make, you should generate a new .r filefrom your updated .rsrc file.  Here is how to accomplish thiswith Apple's Developer Tools:In Terminal:prompt% cd OpenEXR/Photoshop/mac/rsrcprompt% rm ADMDialogs.rprompt% /Developer/Tools/DeRez ADMDialogs.rsrc > ADMDialogs.rThis will remove the old ADMDialogs.r file, and create a new ADMDialogs.r file with the contents of ADMDialogs.rsrc'sresource fork in Rez format.
