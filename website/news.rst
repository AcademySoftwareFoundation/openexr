August 28, 2023 - OpenEXR v3.2.0 Released
=========================================

Minor release with several additions, changes and improvements:

* Zip compression via ``libdeflate``

  As of OpenEXR release v3.2, OpenEXR depends on `libdeflate
  <https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate>`_ for DEFLATE-based
  compression. Previous OpenEXR releases relied on `zlib
  <https://www.zlib.net>`_. Builds of OpenEXR can choose either an
  ``libdeflate`` installation, or CMake can auto-fetch the source and
  build it internally. The internal build is linked statically, so no
  extra shared object is produced.

  See https://openexr.com/en/latest/install.html for more details.

* New camdkit/camdkit-enabled standard attributes

  These changes bring to OpenEXR new standard optional attributes that
  were discussed in the `SMPTE Rapid Industry Solutions On-Set Virtual
  Production
  Initiative <https://www.smpte.org/blog/update-on-smptes-rapid-industry-solutions-ris-on-set-virtual-production-osvp-initiative>`_. Additionally,
  some useful attributes from the SMPTE ACES Container File Layout
  standard, SMPTE ST 2065-4:2023, have been included as well. The new
  attributes are: 

  Support automated editorial workflow:

  - ``reelName``
  - ``imageCounter``
  - ``ascFramingDecisionList``

  Support forensics:

  - ``cameraMake``
  - ``cameraModel``
  - ``cameraSerialNumber``
  - ``cameraFirmware``
  - ``cameraUuid``
  - ``cameraLabel``
  - ``lensMake``
  - ``lensModel``
  - ``lensSerialNumber``
  - ``lensFirmware``
  - ``cameraColorBalance``

  Support pickup shots:

  - ``shutterAngle``
  - ``cameraCCTSetting``
  - ``cameraTintSetting``

  Support metadata-driven match move:

  - ``sensorCenterOffset``
  - ``sensorOverallDimensions``
  - ``sensorPhotositePitch``
  - ``sensorAcquisitionRectangle``
  - ``nominalFocalLength``
  - ``effectiveFocalLength``
  - ``pinholeFocalLength``
  - ``entrancePupilOffset``
  - ``tStop`` (complementing existing aperture)

  Also, ``renderingTransform`` and ``lookTransform`` have been deprecated.

  See https://openexr.com/en/latest/StandardAttributes.html and `PR
  1383
  <https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1383>`_
  for more details.

* Updated SO versioning policy

  This change adopts a policy of appending the ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``
  software release name to the ``SONAME`` to form the real name of the
  shared library.

  See https://openexr.com/en/latest/install.html `PR
  1498
  <https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1498>`_
  for more details.

* Python bindings & PyPI wheel

  Support for the PyPI `OpenEXR python bindings
  <https://pypi.org/project/OpenEXR>`_ have been formally adopted by
  the OpenEXR project.
  
* Miscellaneous improvements:

  - "docs" renamed to "website" (See `PR #1504 <https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1504>`_).

  - Additional deep & multipart code examples (See `PR #1493
    <https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1493>`_
    and `PR #1502 <https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1502>`_)

July 22, 2021 - OpenEXR v3.1.0 Released
=======================================

The 3.1 release of OpenEXR introduces a new library, OpenEXRCore,
which is the result of a significant re-thinking of how OpenEXR
manages file I/O and provides access to image data. It begins to
address long-standing scalability issues with multithreaded image
reading and writing.

The OpenEXRCore library provides thread-safe, non-blocking access to
files, which was not possible with the current API, where the
framebuffer management is separate from read requests. It is written
entirely in C and provides a new C-language API alongside the existing
C++ API. This new low-level API allows applications to do custom
unpacking of EXR data, such as on the GPU, while still benefiting from
efficient I/O, file validation, and other semantics. It provides
efficient direct access to EXR files in texturing applications. This C
library also introduces an easier path to implementing OpenEXR
bindings in other languages, such as Rust.

The 3.1 release represents a technology preview for upcoming
releases. The initial release is incremental; the existing API and
underlying behavior has not changed. The new API is available now for
performance validation testing, and then in future OpenEXR releases,
the C++ API will migrate to use the new core in stages.  It is not the
intention to entirely deprecate the C++ API, nor must all applications
re-implement EXR I/O in terms of the C library. The C API does not,
and will not, provide the rich set of utility classes that exist in
the C++ layer. The 3.1 release of the OpenEXRCore library simply
offers new functionality for specialty applications seeking the
highest possible performance. In the future, the ABI will evolve, but
the API will remain consistent, or only have additions. 

Technical Design
----------------

The OpenEXRCore API introduces a ``context`` object to manage file
I/O. The context provides customization for I/O, memory allocation,
and error handling.  This makes it possible to use a decode and/or
encode pipeline to customize how the chunks are written and read, and
how they are packed or unpacked.

The OpenEXRCore library is built around the concept of “chunks”, or
atomic blocks of data in a file, the smallest unit of data to be read
or written.  The contents of a chunk vary from file to file based on
compression (i.e. zip and zips) and layout (scanline
vs. tiled). Currently this is either 1, 16, or 32 scanlines, or 1 tile
(or subset of a tile on edge boundaries / small mip level).

The OpenEXRCore library is specifically designed for multipart EXR
files. It will continue to produce legacy-compatible single part files
as needed, but the API assumes you are always dealing with a
multi-part file. It also fully supports attributes, although being C,
it lacks some of the C++ layer’s abstraction.

Limitations
-----------

* No support yet for DWAA and DWAB compression during decode and
  encode pipelines. The low-level chunk I/O still works with DWAA and
  DWAB compressed files, but the encoder and decoder are not yet
  included in this release.

* For deep files, reading of deep data is functional, but the path for
  encoding deep data into chunk-level data (i.e. packing and
  compressing) is not yet complete.

* For both of these deficiencies, it is easy to define a custom
  routine to implement this, should it be needed prior to the library
  providing full support.

* No attempt to search through the file and find missing chunks is
  made when a corrupt chunk table is encountered. However, if a
  particular chunk is corrupt, this is handled such that the other
  chunks may be read without rendering the context unusable

July 20, 2021 - Imath v3.1.1
----------------------------

Patch release that fixes a build failure on ARM64 macOS

Download Imath v3.1.1 from
https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/releases/tag/v3.1.1.

July 13, 2021 - Imath v3.1.0 Released
=====================================

Minor release with new features:

* Optimized half-to-float and float-to-half conversion, using F16C SSE
  instruction set if available. Non-SSE conversion eliminates the
  float-to-half exponent lookup table, and half-to-float conversion
  provides a compile-time-optional bit shifting that is slower but
  eliminates the need for the lookup table, for applications where
  memory is limited.

* Half-to-float and float-to-half conversion is also available as
  C-language functions ``imath_half_to_float()`` and
  ``imath_float_to_half()``.
  
* All new conversions produced identical results, and new options are

April 1, 2021 - OpenEXR and Imath v3.0 Released
===============================================

The OpenEXR Project and the Academy Software Foundation (ASWF)
announced the official release of OpenEXR and Imath version 3.0, now
available for developers to integrate into their applications.

The 3.0 release of OpenEXR addresses a number of security issues and
introduces several new features, including ID Manifest attributes, but
it is primarily a major restructuring and simplification of the build
process and modernization of the code that involves moving Imath to an
external project dependency.

Largely backwards compatible with previous releases, Imath 3.0 brings
the library up to modern standards for performance and utility. By
promoting Imath as a project independent of OpenEXR, we hope to
encourage its use throughout the motion picture and computer graphics
community.

See the `Imath
<https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/blob/master/CHANGES.md>`_
and `OpenEXR
<https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/blob/master/CHANGES.md>`_
release notes for details and the `porting guide
<https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/blob/master/docs/PortingGuide2-3.md>`_
for more information about the differences with previous versions. And
read the documentation at https://imath.readthedocs.io. And please report any problems and
share your feedback either through the GitHub repo or
`openexr-dev@lists.aswf.io <mailto:openexr-dev@lists.aswf.io>`_.

March 28, 2021 - OpenEXR v3.0.1-beta Released
=============================================

Beta patch release:

* `OSS-fuzz 32370 <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=32370>`_ Out-of-memory in openexr_exrcheck_fuzzer 
* `OSS-fuzz 32067 <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=32067>`_ account for size of pixels when estimating memory 

March 28, 2021 - Imath v3.0.1-beta Released
===========================================

Beta patch release:

* ``#if IMATH_FOREIGN_VECTOR_INTEROP`` around type detectors
* Forward declarations only if header is not included

March 16, 2020 - OpenEXR v3.0.0-beta Released
=============================================

OpenEXR version v3.0.0-beta is available for download at https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.

Major release with major build restructing, security improvements, and
new features:

* Restructuring:

  * The IlmBase/PyIlmBase submodules have been separated into the
    Imath project, now included by OpenEXR via a CMake submodule
    dependency, fetched automatically via CMake's FetchContent if
    necessary.
  * The library is now called ``libOpenEXR`` (instead of
    ``libIlmImf``).  No header files have been renamed, they
    retain the ``Imf`` prefix.
  * Symbol linkage visibility is limited to specific public symbols.
      

* Build improvements:

  * No more simultaneous static/shared build option.
    Gnu autoconf/bootstrap/configure build setup has been retired.
  * Community-provided support for bazel.
      
* New Features:

  * ID Manifest Attributes, as described in ``
    `"A Scheme for Storing Object ID Manifests in OpenEXR Images" 
    Peter Hillman, DigiPro 18: Proceedings of the 8th Annual Digital
    Production Symposium, August 2018. <https://doi.org/10.1145/3233085.3233086>`_,
  * New program: exrcheck validates the contents of an EXR file.

* Changes:

  * EXR files with no channels are no longer allowed.
  * Hard limit on the size of deep tile sizes; tiles must be less than
    2<sup>30</sup> pixels.
  * Tiled DWAB files used STATIC_HUFFMAN compression.
  * ``Int64`` and ``SInt64`` types are deprecated in ``favor``
    of ``uint64_t`` and ``int64_t``.
  * Header files have been pruned of extraneous ``#include``'s
    ("Include What You Use"), which may generate compiler errors in
    application source code from undefined symbols or
    partially-defined types. These can be resolved by identifying and
    including the appropriate header.
  * See the :doc:`PortingGuide` for details about differences
    from previous releases and how to address them.
  * Also refer to the porting guide for details about changes to
    Imath.

April 9, 2013 - OpenEXR v2.0 Released
=====================================

Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and Weta Digital announce the release
of OpenEXR 2.0, the major version update of the open source high
dynamic range file format first introduced by ILM and maintained and
expanded by a number of key industry leaders including Weta Digital,
Pixar Animation Studios, Autodesk and others.

The release includes a number of new features that align with the
major version number increase. Amongst the major improvements are:

* Deep Data support- Pixels can now store a variable-length list of
  samples. The main rationale behind deep images is to enable the
  storage of multiple values at different depths for each
  pixel. OpenEXR 2.0 supports both hard-surface and volumetric
  representations for Deep Compositing workflows.
	
* Multi-part Image Files - With OpenEXR 2.0, files can now contain a
  number of separate, but related, data parts in one file. Access to
  any part is independent of the others, pixels from parts that are
  not required in the current operation don't need to be accessed,
  resulting in quicker read times when accessing only a subset of
  channels. The multipart interface also incorporates support for
  Stereo images where views are stored in separate parts. This makes
  stereo OpenEXR 2.0 files significantly faster to work with than the
  previous multiview support in OpenEXR.

* Optimized pixel reading - decoding RGB(A) scanline images has been
  accelerated on SSE processors providing a significant speedup when
  reading both old and new format images, including multipart and
  multiview files.

* Namespacing - The library introduces versioned namespaces to avoid
  conflicts between packages compiled with different versions of the
  library.

Although OpenEXR 2.0 is a major version update, files created by the
new library that don't exercise the new feature set are completely
backwards compatible with previous versions of the library. By using
the OpenEXR 2.0 library, performance improvements, namespace versions
and basic multi-part/deep reading support should be available to
applications without code modifications.

This code is designed to support Deep Compositing - a revolutionary
compositing workflow developed at Weta Digital that detached the
rendering of different elements in scene.  In particular, changes in
one layer could be rendered separately without the need to re-render
other layers that would be required to handle holdouts in a
traditional comp workflow or sorting of layers in complex scenes with
elements moving in depth.  Deep Compositing became the primary
compositing workflow on Avatar and has seen wide industry adoption.
The technique allows depth and color value to be stored for every
pixel in a scene allowing for much more efficient handling of large
complex scenes and greater freedom for artists to iterate.

True to the open source ethos, a number of companies contributed to
support the format and encourage adoption.  Amongst others, Pixar
Animation Studios has contributed its DtexToExr converter to the
OpenEXR repository under a Microsoft Public License, which clears any
concerns about existing patents in the area, and Autodesk provided
performance optimizations geared towards real-time post-production
workflows.

Extensive effort has been put in ensuring all requirements were met to
help a wide adoption, staying true to the wide success of
OpenEXR. Many software companies were involved in the beta cycle to
insure support amongst a number of industry leading
applications. Numerous packages like SideFX's Houdini, Autodesk's
Maya, Solid Angle's Arnold renderer, Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open
Image IO have already announced their support of the format.

Open EXR 2.0 is an important step in the adoption of deep compositing
as it provides a consistent file format for deep data that is easy to
read and work with throughout a visual effects pipeline.  The Foundry
has build OpenEXR 2.0 support into its Nuke Compositing application as
the base for the Deep Compositing workflows.

OpenEXR 2.0 is already in use at both Weta Digital and Industrial
Light & Magic. ILM took advantage of the new format on Marvel's The
Avengers and two highly anticipated summer 2013 releases, Pacific Rim
and The Lone Ranger.  Recent examples of Weta Digital's use of the
format also include *Marvel's Avengers* as well as
*Prometheus* and *The Hobbit*.  In addition, a large
number of visual effects studios have already integrated a deep
workflow into their compositing pipelines or are in the process of
doing so including:, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Pixar Animation
Studios, Rhythm & Hues, Fuel and MPC.

In addition to visual effects, the new additions to the format, means
that depth data can also be assigned to two-dimensional data for a use
in many design fields including, architecture, graphic design,
automotive and product prototyping.

July 31st, 2012 - OpenEXR v1.7.1 Released
=========================================

OpenEXR v1.7.1 has been released and is available for download. This release includes the following components:

*  OpenEXR: v1.7.1
*  IlmBase: v1.0.3
*  PyIlmBase: v1.0.0 (introduces a Boost dependency)
*  OpenEXR_Viewers: v1.0.2

Of particular note is the introduction of PyIlmBase. This module forms
a comprehensive set of python bindings to the IlmBase module.

In addition, contained in this release is a number of additions to
Imath as well as a minor tweak to Imath::Frustrum (for better support
for Windows platforms) as well as other minor fixes, including
correction for soname version of IlmImf.

June 18, 2012 - OpenEXR v2 Released
===================================

We're pleased to announce the first public Beta release of OpenEXR v2.

Development of OpenEXR v2 has been undertaken in a collaborative
environment (cf. previous ``github`` announcement) comprised of
Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital as well as a number of other
contributors.  Some of the new features included in the Beta.1 release
of OpenEXR v2 are:

* Deep Data. Pixels can now store a variable length list of samples.
  The main rationale behind deep-images is to have multiple values at
  different depths for each pixel. OpenEXR v2 supports both hard
  surface and volumetric representation requirements for deep
  compositing workflows.

* Multi-part image files. With OpenEXR v2, files can now contain a
  number of separate, but related, images in one file. Access to any
  part is independent of the others; in particular, no access of data
  need take place for unrequested parts.

In addition, OpenEXR v2 also contains platform independent mechanisms
for handling co-existing library version conflicts in the same process
space. (Currently implemented in IlmImf)

Finally, a reminder that this is a Beta release and potentially
incompatible changes may be introduced in future releases prior to the
v2.0.0 production version.

OpenEXR v2Beta.1 can be found at https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/tree/v2_beta.1.

from http://www.oscars.org/council/ctl.html.

January 22, 2007
================

The Color Transformation Language, or CTL, is a programming language
for digital color management.  Color management requires translating
images between different representations or color spaces.  CTL allows
users to describe color transforms in a concise and unambiguous way by
expressing them as programs.  In order to apply a given transform to
an image, a color management system instructs a CTL interpreter to
load and run the CTL program that describes the transform.

The image viewers included in the OpenEXR software distribution,
exrdisplay and playexr, both support color rendering via CTL.  For
more information see `http://www.openexr.com/OpenEXRViewers.pdf
<http://www.openexr.com/OpenEXRViewers.pdf>`_.

Source code and documentation for the CTL interpreter can be downloaded
from http://ampasctl.sourceforge.net. Please note the 
license under which CTL is distributed; it is similar but not
identical to the OpenEXR license.

December 15, 2006
=================

A new development version of OpenEXR is now available.  We have tested
the code in this version internally at ILM, but we would like to get
feedback from others before we release a production version.

The new version includes several significant changes:

* OpenEXR supports a new image compression method, called B44.  It has
  a fixed compression rate of 2.28:1, or 4.57:1 if used in ``combination``
  with luminance/chroma encoding.  B44-compressed images can be
  uncompressed fast enough to support real-time playback of image
  sequences.

* The new playexr program plays back moving image sequences.  Playexr
  is multi-threaded and utilizes the threading capabilities of the
  IlmImf library that were introduced in OpenEXR 1.3.0.  The program
  plays back B44-compressed images with fairly high-resolution in ``real``
  time on commodity hardware.

* The playexr program and a new version of the existing exrdisplay
  image viewer both support color rendering via color transforms
  written in the new Color Transformation Language or CTL. CTL is not
  part of OpenEXR; it will be released separately. CTL support in
  playexr and exrdisplay is optional; the programs can be built and
  will run without CTL.

* In preparation for the release of CTL, OpenEXR has been split into
  three separate packages:

* IlmBase 0.9.0 includes the Half, Iex, Imath and IlmThread libraries

* OpenEXR 1.5.0 includes the IlmImf library, programming examples and
  utility programs such as exrheader or exrenvmap

* OpenEXRViewers 0.9.0 includes the playexr and exrdisplay programs

* The "Technical Introduction to OpenEXR" document now includes a
  recommendation for storing CIE XYZ pixel data in OpenEXR files.

* A new "OpenEXR Image Viewing Software" document describes the
  playexr and exrdisplay programs.  It briefly explains real-time
  playback and color rendering, and includes recommendations for
  testing if other image viewing software displays OpenEXR images
  correctly.

* The OpenEXR sample image set now includes B44-compressed files and
  files with CIE XYZ pixel data.
      
August 8, 2006
==============

We have released an updated set of sample OpenEXR images.  This
release includes several new images that are useful for testing
OpenEXR applications.  The images are organized by subdirectory
according to their image type or purpose.  Several of these
subdirectories contain README files that explain the contents of the
images in those subdirectories.

August 2, 2006
==============

OpenEXR 1.4.0 is now available.  This is the next major
production-ready release of OpenEXR and offers full compatibility with
our last production release, which was 1.2.2.  This version obsoletes
versions 1.3.x, which were test versions for 1.4.0.  If you have been
using 1.3.x, please upgrade to 1.4.0.  <hr>

June 8, 2006
============

OpenEXR 1.3.0 is now available.

This is a test release.  The major new feature in this version is
support for multithreaded file I/O.  We've been testing the threaded
code internally at ILM for a few months, and we have not encountered
any bugs, but we'd like to get some feedback from others before we
release the production version.
	     
Here's a summary of the changes since version 1.2.2:
	     
* Support for multithreaded file reading and writing.

* Support for Intel-based OS X systems.

* Support for Visual Studio 2005.

* Better handling of PLATFORM_* and HAVE_* macros.

* Updated documentation.

* Bug fixes related to handling of incomplete and damaged files.

* Numerous bug fixes and cleanups to the autoconf-based build system.

* Removed support for the following configurations that were
  previously supported.  Some of these configurations may happen to
  continue to function, but we can't help you if they don't, largely
  because we don't have any way to test them:

  * IRIX
  * OSF1
  * SunOS
  * OS X versions prior to 10.3.
  * gcc on any platform prior to version 3.3


March 15, 2005
==============

We're pleased to announce the release of OpenEXR 1.2.2.  This is a
relatively minor update to the project, with the following changes:

* New build system for Windows; support for DLLs.
* Switched documentation from HTML to PDF format.
* IlmImf: support for image layers in ``ChannelList.``
* IlmImf: added ``isComplete()`` method to file classes to check whether a
  file is complete.
* IlmImf: exposed ``staticInitialize()`` in ``ImfHeader.h`` in order to allow
  thread-safe library initialization in multithreaded applications.
* IlmImf: New "time code" standard attribute.
* exrdisplay: support for displaying wrap-around texture map images.
* exrmaketiled: can now specify wrap mode.
* IlmImf: New "wrapmodes" standard attribute to indicate extrapolation
  mode for mipmaps and ripmaps.
* IlmImf: New "key code" standard attribute to identify motion picture
  film frames.
* Imath: Removed ``TMatrix<T>`` classes; these classes are still
  under development and are too difficult to keep in sync with OpenEXR
  CVS.

August 10, 2004
===============

ILM's OpenEXR color management proposal, presented at the Siggraph
2004 "OpenEXR, Film and Color" Birds of a Feather meeting, is now
available online.  See the documentation section.

June 6, 2004
============

OpenEXR 1.2.1 is now available.  This is a fairly minor release,
mostly just a few tweaks, a few bug fixes, and some new documentation.
Here are the most important changes:

* reduced memory footprint of exrenvmap and exrmaketiled utilities.
* IlmImf: new helper functions to determine whether a file is an
  OpenEXR file, and whether it's scanline- or tile-based.
* IlmImf: bug fix for PXR24 compression with ySampling != 1.
* Better support for gcc 3.4.
* Warning cleanups in Visual C++.

May 11, 2004
============

OpenEXR 1.2.0 is now available.  This is the first official,
production-ready release since OpenEXR 1.0.7.  If you have been using
the development 1.1 series, please switch to 1.2.0 as soon as
possible.

We believe that OpenEXR 1.2.0 is ready for use in shipping
applications.  We have been using it in production at ILM for several
months now with no problems.

There are quite a few major new features in the 1.2 series as compared
to the original 1.0 series:

* Support for tiled images, including mipmaps and ripmaps.  Note that
  software based on the 1.0 series cannot read or write tiled images.
  However, simply by recompiling your software against the 1.2
  release, any code that reads scanline images can read tiled images,
  too.

* A new Pxr24 compressor, contributed by Pixar Animation Studios.
  Values produced by the Pxr24 compressor provide the same range as
  32-bit floating-point numbers with slightly less precision, and
  compress quite a bit better.  The Pxr24 compressor stores UINT and
  HALF channels losslessly, and for these data types performs
  similarly to the ZIP compressor.

* OpenEXR now supports high dynamic-range YCA (luminance/chroma/alpha)
  images with subsampled chroma channels.  These files are supported
  via the RGBA convenience interface, so that data is presented to the
  application as RGB(A) but stored in the file as YC(A).  OpenEXR also
  supports Y and YA (black-and-white/black-and-white with alpha)
  images.

* An abstracted file I/O interface, so that you can use OpenEXR with
  interfaces other than C++'s iostreams.

* Several new utilities for manipulating tiled image files.

See the downloads section to download the source code and sample
images.

Mar 27, 2004
============

OpenEXR 1.1.1 is now available.  This another development release.  We
expect to release a stable version, 1.2, around the end of April.
Version 1.1.1 includes support for PXR24 compression, and for
high-dynamic-range luminance/chroma images with subsampled chroma
channels.  Version 1.1.1 also fixes a bug in the 1.1.0 tiled file
format.

Mar 27, 2004
============

We are pleased to announce that Pixar Animation Studios has
contributed code to OpenEXR for a new lossy compression method, which
compresses 32-bit floating-point data quite a bit better than
OpenEXR's other compressors.  This new compressor is called PXR24 and
is available as of the 1.1.1 development release of OpenEXR.  It will
also be included in the upcoming 1.2 stable release.  Thanks to Loren
Carpenter and Dana Batali of Pixar, for making this happen!

Feb 6, 2004
===========

OpenEXR 1.1.0 is now available.  This is a major new release with
support for tiled images, multi-resolution files (mip/ripmaps),

OpenEXR 1.0.7 is now available.  In addition to some bug fixes, this
version adds support for some new standard attributes, such as primary
and white point chromaticities, lens aperture, film speed, image
acquisition time and place, and more.  If you want to use these new
attributes in your applications, see the ImfStandardAttributes.h
header file for documentation.

Our project hosting site, Savannah, is still recovering from a
compromise last month, so in the meantime, we're hosting file
downloads here.  Some of the files are not currently available, but
we're working to restore them.
