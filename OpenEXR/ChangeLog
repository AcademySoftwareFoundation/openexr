Version 1.0.4:
        * OpenEXR is now covered by a modified BSD license.  See LICENSE
	  for the new terms.

Version 1.0.3:

	* OpenEXR is now in sf.net CVS.
	* Imf::Xdr namespace cleanups.
	* Some IlmImfTest cleanups for OS X.
	* Use .cpp extension in exrdisplay sources.
	* Iex cleanups.
	* Make IlmImf compile with Metrowerks Codewarrior.
	* Change large automatic stacks in ImfHuf.C to auto_ptrs allocated
	  off the heap.  MacOS X default stack size isn't large enough.
	* std::ios fix for MacOS X in ImfInputFile.C.
	* Added new FP predecessor/successor functions to Imath, added
	  tests to ImathTest
	* Fixed a bug in Imath::extractSHRT for 3x3 matricies when
	  exactly one of the original scaling factors is negative, updated
	  ImathTest to check this case.
	* Install include files when 'make install' is run.
	* exrdisplay requires fltk 1.1+ now in an effort to support
	  a MacOS X display program (fltk 1.1 runs on OS X), though this
	  is untested.
	* renamed configure.in to configure.ac
	* Removed some tests from IexTest that are no longer used.
	* Removed ImfHalfXdr.h, it's not used anymore.
	* Revamped the autoconf system, added some compile-time 
          optimizations, a pkgconfig target, and some maintainer-specific
          stuff.
