          argument, see ImathMatrixAlgo.h for details.  (Various)
	* Added Wojciech Jarosz to AUTHORS file.
	* Added test cases for uncompressed case, preview images,
	  frame buffer type conversion.  (Wojciech Jarosz,
	  Florian Kainz)
	* Fix a bug in IlmImf where uncompressed data doesn't get
	  read/written correctly.  (Wojciech Jarosz)
	* Added support for preview images and preview image
	  attributes (thumbnail images) in IlmImf.  (Florian Kainz)

	  in IlmImf.  (Florian Kainz)
	* Cleaned up some compile-time checks.
	* Added HalfTest unit tests.
	* [exrdisplay] Download half framebuffer to texture memory 
	  instead of converting to float first.  Requires latest
	  Nvidia drivers.

Version 1.0.5:
        * Fixed IlmImf.dll to use static runtime libs (Andreas).
	* Added exrheader project to Visual Studio 6.0 workspace.
	* Added some example code showing how to use the IlmImf library.
	  (Florian)
	* Use DLL runtime libs for Win32 libraries rather than static
	  runtime libs.
	* Add an exrdisplay_fragshader project to the Visual Studio 6.0
	  workspace to enable fragment shaders in Win32.
	* Add an IlmImfDll project to the Visual Studio 6.0 workspace.
	* In Win32, export the ImfCRgbaFile C interface via a DLL so
	  that Visual C++ 6.0 users can link against an Intel-compiled
	  IlmImf.  (Andreas Kahler)
	* Use auto_ptr in ImfAutoArray on Win32, it doesn't like large 
	  automatic stacks.
	* Performance improvements in PIZ decoding, between
	  20 and 60% speedup on Athlon and Pentium 4 systems.
          (Florian)
	* Updated the README with various information, made
	  some cosmetic changes for readability.
	* Added fragment shader support to exrdisplay.
        * Bumped the version to 1.0.5 in prep for release.
	* Updated README and README.OSX to talk about CodeWarrior 
          project files.
	* Incorporated Rodrigo Damazio's patch for an openexr.m4
	  macro file and an openexr.spec file for building RPMs.
	* Small change in ImfAttribute.h to make IlmImf compile with gcc 2.95.
	* Updated ImfDoubleAttribute.h for Codewarrior on MacOS.
	* Added exrheader utility.
	* Update to AUTHORS file.
	* Added a README.win32 file.
	* Added project files for Visual Studio 6.0.
	* Initial Win32 port.  Requires Visual Studio 6.0 and Intel C++
	  compiler version 7.0.
	* Added new intersectT method in ImathSphere.h
	* Fixed some bugs in ImathQuat.h
	* Proper use of fltk-config to get platform-specific FLTK
	  compile- and link-time flags.
	* exrdisplay uses Imath::Math<T>::pow instead of powf now.
	  powf is not availble on all platforms.
	* Roll OS X "hack" into the source until Apple fixes their
	  istream implementation.
	
Version 1.0.4:
        * OpenEXR is now covered by a modified BSD license.  See LICENSE
	  for the new terms.

Version 1.0.3:

	* OpenEXR is now in sf.net CVS.
	* Imf::Xdr namespace cleanups.
	* Some IlmImfTest cleanups for OS X.
	* Use .cpp extension in exrdisplay sources.
	* Iex cleanups.
	* Make IlmImf compile with Metrowerks Codewarrior.
	* Change large automatic stacks in ImfHuf.C to auto_ptrs allocated
	  off the heap.  MacOS X default stack size isn't large enough.
	* std::ios fix for MacOS X in ImfInputFile.C.
	* Added new FP predecessor/successor functions to Imath, added
	  tests to ImathTest
	* Fixed a bug in Imath::extractSHRT for 3x3 matricies when
	  exactly one of the original scaling factors is negative, updated
	  ImathTest to check this case.
	* Install include files when 'make install' is run.
	* exrdisplay requires fltk 1.1+ now in an effort to support
	  a MacOS X display program (fltk 1.1 runs on OS X), though this
	  is untested.
	* renamed configure.in to configure.ac
	* Removed some tests from IexTest that are no longer used.
	* Removed ImfHalfXdr.h, it's not used anymore.
	* Revamped the autoconf system, added some compile-time 
          optimizations, a pkgconfig target, and some maintainer-specific
          stuff.
