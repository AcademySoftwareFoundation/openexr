Version 1.2.2:
	* Updated README to remove option for building with Visual C++ 6.0.
	  (Drew Hess)
	* Some older versions of gcc don't support a full iomanip
	  implemenation; check for this during configuration. 
	  (Drew Hess)
	* Install PDF versions of documentation, remove old/out-of-date
	  HTML documentation.  (Florian Kainz)
	* Removed vc/vc6 directory; Visual C++ 6.0 is no longer
	  supported.  (Drew Hess)
	* Updated README.win32 with details of new build system.
	  (Florian Kainz, Drew Hess)
	* New build system for Windows / Visual C++ 7 builds both
	  static libraries and DLLs.
	  (Nick Porcino)
	* Removed Imath::TMatrix<T> and related classes, which are not
	  used anywhere in OpenEXR.
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* Added minimal support for "image layers" to class Imf::ChannelList
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* Added new isComplete() method to InputFile, TiledInputFile
	  etc., that checks if a file is complete or if any pixels
	  are missing (for example, because writing the file was
	  aborted prematurely).
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* Exposed staticInitialize() function in ImfHeader.h in order
	  to allow thread-safe library initialization in multithreaded
	  programs.
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* Added a new "time code" attribute
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* exrmaketiled: when a MIPMAP_LEVELS or RIPMAP_LEVELS image
	  is produced, low-pass filtering takes samples outside the
	  image's data window.  This requires extrapolating the image.
	  The user can now specify how the image is extrapolated
	  horizontally and vertically (image is surrounded by black /
	  outermost row of pixels repeats / entire image repeats /
	  entire image repeats, every other copy is a mirror image).
	  exrdisplay: added option to swap the top and botton half,
	  and the left and right half of an image, so that the image's
	  four corners end up in the center.  This is useful for checking
	  the seams of wrap-around texture map images.
	  IlmImf library: Added new "wrapmodes" standard attribute
	  to indicate the extrapolation mode for MIPMAP_LEVELS and
	  RIPMAP_LEVELS images.
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* Added a new "key code" attribute to identify motion picture
	  film frames.
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* Removed #include <Iex.h> from ImfAttribute.h, ImfHeader.h
	  and ImfXdr.h so that including header files such as
	  ImfInputFile.h no longer defines ASSERT and THROW macros,
	  which may conflict with similar macros defined by
	  application programs.
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* Converted HTML documentation to OpenOffice format to
	  make maintaining the documents easier:
	      api.html -> ReadingAndWritingImageFiles.sxw
	      details.html -> TechnicalIntroduction.sxw
	  (Florian Kainz)

Version 1.2.1:
	* exrenvmap and exrmaketiled use slightly less memory
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* Added functions to IlmImf for quickly testing if a file
	  is an OpenEXR file, and whether the file is scan-line
	  based or tiled. (Florian Kainz)
	* Added preview image examples to IlmImfExamples.  Added
	  description of preview images and environment maps to
	  docs/api.html (Florian Kainz)
	* Bug fix: PXR24 compression did not work properly for channels
	  with ySampling != 1.
	  (Florian Kainz)
        * Made template <class T> become  template <class S, class T> for 
          the transform(ObjectS, ObjectT) methods. This was done to allow
          for differing templated objects to be passed in e.g.  say a 
          Box<Vec3<S>> and a Matrix44<T>, where S=float and T=double.
          (Jeff Yost, Arkell Rasiah)
        * New method Matrix44::setTheMatrix(). Used for assigning a 
          M44f to a M44d. (Jeff Yost, Arkell Rasiah)
        * Added convenience Color typedefs for half versions of Color3
          and Color4. Note the Makefile.am for both Imath and ImathTest
          have been updated with -I and/or -L pathing to Half.
          (Max Chen, Arkell Rasiah)
        * Methods equalWithAbsError() and equalWithRelError() are now
          declared as const. (Colette Mullenhoff, Arkell Rasiah)
        * Fixes for gcc34. Mainly typename/template/using/this syntax
          correctness changes. (Nick Ramussen, Arkell Rasiah)
	* Added Custom low-level file I/O examples to IlmImfExamples
	  and to the docs/api.html document.  (Florian Kainz)
	* Eliminated most warnings messages when OpenEXR is compiled
	  with Visual C++.  The OpenEXR code uses lots of (intentional
	  and unintended) implicit type conversions.  By default, Visual
	  C++ warns about almost all of them.  Most implicit conversions
	  have been removed from the .h files, so that including them
	  should not generate warnings even at warning level 3.  Most
	  .cpp files are now compiled with warning level 1.
	  (Florian Kainz)

Version 1.2.0:
	* Production-ready release.
	* Disable long double warnings on OS X.  (Drew Hess)
	* Add new source files to VC7 IlmImfDll target.  (Drew Hess)
	* Iex: change the way that APPEND_EXC and REPLACE_EXC modify
	  their what() string to work around an issue with Visual C++
	  7.1.  (Florian Kainz, Nick Porcino)
	* Bumped OpenEXR version to 1.2 and .so versions to 2.0.0 in
	  preparation for the release.  (Drew Hess)
	* Imath: fixed ImathTMatrix.h to work with gcc 3.4.  (Drew Hess)
	* Another quoting fix in openexr.m4.  (Drew Hess)
	* Quoting fix in acinclude.m4 for automake 1.8.  (Brad Hards)
	* Imath: put inline at beginning of declaration in ImathMatrix.h
	  to fix a warning.  (Ken McGaugh)
	* Imath: made Vec equalWith*Error () methods const.
	* Cleaned up compile-time Win32 support.  (Florian Kainz)
	* Bug fix: Reading a particular broken PIZ-compressed file
	  caused crashes by indexing off the end of an array.
	  (Florian Kainz)

Version 1.1.1:
	* Half: operator= and variants now return by reference rather
	  than by value.  This brings half into conformance with
	  built-in types.  (Drew Hess)
	* Half: remove copy constructor, let compiler supply its
	  own.  This improves performance up to 25% on some
	  expressions using half.  (Drew Hess)
	* configure: don't try to be fancy with CXXFLAGS, just use
	  what the user supplies or let configure choose a sensible
	  default if CXXFLAGS is not defined.
        * IlmImf: fixed a bug in reading scanline files on big-endian
          architectures.  (Drew Hess)
	* exrmaketiled: Added an option to select compression type.
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* exrenvmap: Added an option to select compression type.
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* exrdisplay: Added some new command-line options.  (Florian Kainz)
	* IlmImf: Added Pixar's new "slightly lossy" image compression
	  method.  The new method, named PXR24, preserves HALF and
	  UINT data without loss, but FLOAT pixels are converted to
	  a 24-bit representation.  PXR24 appears to compress
	  FLOAT depth buffers very well without losing much accuracy.
	  (Loren Carpenter, Florian Kainz)
	* Changed top-level LICENSE file to allow for other copyright
	  holders for individual files.
	* IlmImf: TILED FILE FORMAT CHANGE.  TiledOutputFile was
	  incorrectly interleaving channels and scanlines before
	  passing pixel data to a compressor.  The lossless compressors
	  still work, but lossy compressors do not.  Fix the bug by
	  interleaving channels and scanlines in tiled files in the
	  same way as ScanLineOutputFile does.  Programs compiled with
	  the new version of IlmImf cannot read tiled images produced
	  with version 1.1.0.  (Florian Kainz)
	* IlmImf: ImfXdr.h fix for 64-bit architectures.  (Florian Kainz)
	* IlmImf: OpenEXR now supports YCA (luminance/chroma/alpha)
	  images with subsampled chroma channels.  When an image
	  is written with the RGBA convenience interface, selecting
	  WRITE_YCA instead of WRITE_RGBA causes the library to
	  convert the pixels to YCA format.  If WRITE_Y is selected,
	  only luminance is stored in the file (for black and white
	  images).  When an image file is read with the RGBA convenience
	  interface, YCA data are automatically converted back to RGBA.
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* IlmImf: speed up reading tiled files as scan lines.
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* Half:  Fixed subtle bug in Half where signaling float NaNs
	  were being converted to inf in half.  (Florian Kainz)
	* gcc 3.3 compiler warning cleanups.  (various)
	* Imath: ImathEuler.h fixes for gcc 3.4.  (Garrick Meeker)
	
Version 1.1.0:
	* Added new targets to Visual C++ .NET 2003 project
	  for exrmaketiled, exrenvmap, exrmakepreview, and exrstdattr.
	  (Drew Hess)
	* A few assorted Win32 fixes for Imath.  (Drew Hess)
	* GNU autoconf builds now produce versioned libraries.
	  This release is 1:0:0.  (Drew Hess)
	* Fixes for Visual C++ .NET 2003.  (Paul Schneider)
	* Updated Visual C++ zlib project file to zlib 1.2.1.
	  (Drew Hess)
        * exrdisplay: Fixed fragment shader version.  (Drew Hess)
	* *Test: Fixed some compiler issues.  (Drew Hess)
	* Imath: Handle "restrict" keyword properly.  (Drew Hess)
	* IlmImfExamples: Updated to latest versions of example
	  source code, includes tiling and multi-res images.
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* exrmakepreview: A new utility to create preview images.
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* exrenvmap: A new utility to create OpenEXR environment
	  maps.  (Florian Kainz)
	* exrstdattr: A new utility to modify standard 
	  attributes.  (Florian Kainz)
	* Updated exrheader to print level rounding mode and
	  preview image size.  (Florian Kainz)
	* Updated exrmaketiled to use level rounding mode.
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* IlmImf: Changed the orientation of lat-long envmaps to
	  match typical panoramic camera setups.  (Florian Kainz)
	* IlmImf: Fixed a bug where partially-completed files with
	  DECREASING_Y could not be read.  (Florian Kainz)
	* IlmImf: Added support for selectable rounding mode (up/down)
	  when generating multiresolution files.  (Florian Kainz)
	* exrdisplay: Support for tiled images, mip/ripmaps, preview
	  images, and display windows.  (Florian Kainz, Drew Hess)
	* exrmaketiled: A new utility which generates tiled
	  versions of OpenEXR images.  (Florian Kainz)
	* IlmImf: Changed Imf::VERSION to Imf::EXR_VERSION to
	  work around problems with autoconf VERSION macro
	  conflict.  (Drew Hess)
	* exrheader: Support for tiles, mipmaps, environment
	  maps.  (Florian Kainz)
	* IlmImf: Environment map support.  (Florian Kainz)
	* IlmImf: Abstracted stream I/O support.  (Florian Kainz)
	* IlmImf: Support for tiled and mip/ripmapped files;
	  requires new file format.  (Wojciech Jarosz, Florian Kainz)
	* Imath: TMatrix*, generic 2D matricies and algorithms.
	  (Francesco Callari)
	* Imath: major quaternions cleanup.  (Cary Phillips)
	* Imath: added GLBegin, GLPushAttrib, GLPushMatrix objects
	  for automatic cleanup on exceptions.  (Cary Phillips)
	* Imath: removed implicit scalar->vector promotions and vector
	  comparisons.  (Nick Rasmussen)
	
Version 1.0.7:
	* Fixed a typo in one of the IlmImfTest tests. (Paul Schneider)
	* Fixed a bug in exrdisplay that causes the image to display
	  as all black if there's a NaN or infinity in an OpenEXR
	  image. (Florian Kainz)
	* Updated exrheader per recent changes to IlmImf library.
	  (Florian Kainz)
	* Changed an errant float to a T in ImathFrame.h nextFrame().
	  (Cary Phillips)
	* Support for new "optional standard" attributes
	  (chromaticities, luminance, comments, etc.).
	  (Florian Kainz, Greg Ward, Joseph Goldstone)
	* Fixed a buffer overrun in ImfOpaqueAttribute. (Paul Schneider)
	* Added new function, isImfMagic (). (Florian Kainz)
	
Version 1.0.6:
	* Added README.win32 to disted files.
	* Fixed OpenEXR.pc.in pkg-config file, OpenEXR now works
	  with pkg-config.
	* Random fixes to readme files for new release.
	* Fixed openexr.m4, now looks in /usr by default.
	* Added Visual Studio .NET 2003 "solution."
	* Fixes for Visual Studio .NET 2003 w/ Microsoft C++ compiler.
	  (Various)
	* Random Imath fixes and enhancements.  Note that

	* Added test cases for uncompressed case, preview images,
	  frame buffer type conversion.  (Wojciech Jarosz,
	  Florian Kainz)

        * Fixed IlmImf.dll to use static runtime libs (Andreas).
	* Added exrheader project to Visual Studio 6.0 workspace.
	* Added some example code showing how to use the IlmImf library.
	  (Florian)
	* Use DLL runtime libs for Win32 libraries rather than static
	  runtime libs.
	* Add an exrdisplay_fragshader project to the Visual Studio 6.0
	  workspace to enable fragment shaders in Win32.
	* Add an IlmImfDll project to the Visual Studio 6.0 workspace.
	* In Win32, export the ImfCRgbaFile C interface via a DLL so
	  that Visual C++ 6.0 users can link against an Intel-compiled
	  IlmImf.  (Andreas Kahler)
	* Use auto_ptr in ImfAutoArray on Win32, it doesn't like large 
	  automatic stacks.
