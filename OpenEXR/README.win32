OpenEXR on Win32 platforms
--------------------------

OpenEXR has been tested on Windows XP with Visual Studio .NET 2003
(version 7.1); and with Visual Studio 6.0 and version 7.0 of the Intel
C++ compiler.  You can obtain an evaluation license for Intel's compiler
here:

  http://developer.intel.com/software/products/compilers/cwin/eval.htm

Due to limitations in Microsoft's C++ implementation in Visual Studio
6.0, OpenEXR won't compile with the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler.
The changes required to make OpenEXR compile with Visual C++ 6.0 would
break the existing API.

If you want to use OpenEXR with Visual Studio 6.0 and the Microsoft
Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, you can use the ImfCRgbaFile C interface via
the IlmImf DLL.  Make sure you build the IlmImfDll project in the
workspace file if you want to use this DLL.

See the AUTHORS file for a list of people who contributed to the Win32
port of OpenEXR.


Compiling OpenEXR in Visual Studio 
----------------------------------

If you don't want or don't need to build these libraries from scratch,
some releases may be available as pre-compiled libraries.  Check here:

  http://openexr.com/downloads

The projects for Visual Studio 6.0 and .NET 2003 can be found in
vc\vc6 and vc\vc7, respectively.

You'll need a compiled version of zlib (version 1.2.1) in order to build
the IlmImf library.  You'll need a compiled version of FLTK 1.1.x in order
to build the exrdisplay viewer.  You can get source code for these libraries
here:

http://www.zlib.net
http://www.fltk.org

FLTK comes with a workspace file for Visual Studio 6.0 (and Visual
Studio .NET 2003 can automatically convert it to a "solution" file).

Note that by default, the OpenEXR Visual Studio project expects the
FLTK libraries in the following locations (assuming OpenEXR\ is your
OpenEXR source directory):

  zlib\
       zconf.h
       zlib.h
       zlib.lib
       zlibd.lib
       zlib_static.lib
       zlibd_static.lib
  fltk\
       FL\
          Enumerations.H
          Fl.H
          ...
       lib\
           fltk.lib
           fltkgl.lib
	   fltkd.lib
	   fltkgld.lib
  OpenEXR\...

In order to build the fragment shader version of exrdisplay, you'll need
the Nvidia Cg SDK.  The exrdisplay_fragshader project expects the
SDK to be rooted in the same directory as the OpenEXR source directory:

  nvidia\
         SDK\
	     inc\
  OpenEXR\...

Building OpenEXR requires the following steps:

  * Obtain the zlib (version 1.2.2) source code from www.zlib.net, and
    build the following configurations:
    
      LIB ASM Debug
      LIB ASM Release
      DLL ASM Release

  * In directory OpenEXR\vc\vc7, create the following sub-directories:

      OpenEXR\vc\vc7\bin
      OpenEXR\vc\vc7\lib
      OpenEXR\vc\vc7\include

  * From the zlib build, copy the following files:

      zlib1.dll                                       -> OpenEXR\vc\vc7\bin
      zconf.h zlib.h                                  -> OpenEXR\vc\vc7\include
      zlib1.exp zlib1.lib zlibd.lib zlib.lib vc70.pdb -> OpenEXR\vc\vc7\lib

  * If you want to build exrdisplay, obtain the FLTK source code and build
    the Debug and Release configurations.

  * Build the Release configuration of createDLL from the createDLL
    solution file (OpenEXR\vc\vc7\createDLL.sln).

  * Set up the MSVCLINK environment variable to point to
      c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio.Net 2003\vc\bin\link.exe
    or the equivalent on your installation.

  * Open the OpenEXR solution file (OpenEXR\vc\vc7\OpenEXR.sln).

  * Pick the configuration you need (Debug, DebugDLL, Release or ReleaseDLL)
    and build it.

  * Enjoy.
  

Known bugs
----------

The IlmImfTest testCustomAttributes test fails with Visual Studio 6.0
and the Intel C++ compiler version 7.0.  It appears to be specific to
the test, not any of the OpenEXR libraries themselves.  It's #ifdef'ed
out at the moment to ensure the other tests in IlmImfTest will run.
