OpenEXR 1.1.1 Release Notes
---------------------------

This is a brand new release of OpenEXR with significant new
functionality.  Consequently, there are a few issues with it; we're
working on these and plan to fix them (where possible) before the next
production release.

Note that this release and all subsequent 1.1.x releases are
development releases.  Please don't use it for production software
yet, but test it and let us know if you find problems with it.  We
plan to release the next production version of OpenEXR, version 1.2,
sometime in late April, once we feel that the new functionality is
stable.


GCC versions
------------

The "official" supported version of gcc for OpenEXR is 3.3.2 on GNU/Linux,
and 3.3 on OS X.  gcc 3.1 on OS X is also supported (required for building
the OpenEXR Shake plugin for OS X).

Some older versions of gcc work with varying success, and some are not
currently supported.

  version  notes

   2.96    ImathTest/testTMatrix.cpp doesn't compile.  Everything else
           appears to be fine.
   2.95.3  Has problems compiling new tiled code.  We are working on
	   this, but we may have reached a point at which this
	   compiler will not be supported as of version 1.2 of
	   OpenEXR.  Note that this compiler is required for building
	   the OpenEXR Shake plugin for GNU/Linux.  If you need
	   to use this compiler, please use version 1.0.7 of OpenEXR
	   until we can figure something out.

We have not tried other versions of gcc yet.  If you have problems with
a particular version of gcc, please let us know by posting on the
OpenEXR developer's list <openexr-devel@nongnu.org>.


Visual C++ versions
-------------------

There are no known issues with Visual Studio .NET 2003 and OpenEXR 1.1.1.

Earlier versions of Visual Studio with the Microsoft C++ compiler are
not supported, and most likely will not be, as these compilers are
deficient in their support for ISO C++.


Intel C++ for Windows
---------------------

Intel C++ 7.0 and later is known to compile earlier versions of
OpenEXR.  It should be able to compile the 1.1.1 release of OpenEXR as
well.  However, we have not tested it.

Also, if you are using Visual Studio 6 with the Intel C++ compiler, 
we have not yet updated the Visual Studio 6 project files for this
release.  We would gladly accept any community efforts to update these
files (we simply haven't had time yet).  We do expect to support this
environment again before the release of version 1.2.


Metrowerks Codewarrior for OS X
-------------------------------

You may encounter a problem compiling parts of OpenEXR with this
compiler.  We're working on a fix and plan to support it before the
release of version 1.2.


Fragment shader version of exrdisplay
-------------------------------------

The fragment shader version of exrdisplay does not yet handle offset
display windows correctly.  We will fix this before the release of
version 1.2.
