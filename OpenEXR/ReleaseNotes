OpenEXR 1.1.0 Release Notes
---------------------------

This is a brand new release of OpenEXR with significant new functionality.
Consequently there are a few issues with it; we're working on these and
plan to fix them (where possible) in the next release.


GCC versions
------------

The "official" supported version of gcc for OpenEXR is 3.3.2 on GNU/Linux,
and 3.3 on OS X.  gcc 3.1 on OS X is also supported (required for building
the OpenEXR Shake plugin for OS X).

Some older versions of gcc work with varying success, and some are not
currently supported.

  version  notes

   2.96    Imath/testTMatrix.cpp doesn't compile.  Everything else
           appears to be fine.
   2.95.3  Has problems compiling new tiled code.  We are working on
	   this.  This compiler is required for building the OpenEXR
	   Shake plugin for GNU/Linux.

We have not tried other versions of gcc yet.  If you have problems with
a particular version of gcc, please let us know by posting on the
OpenEXR developer's list <openexr-devel@nongnu.org>.


Visual C++ versions
-------------------

Visual Studio .NET 2003 with the latest updates compiles OpenEXR and
all of the bundled utilities.  It is unable to compile some of the files
in ImathTest.  We are working on this.  As far as we're aware, OpenEXR
is working with this compiler.

Earlier versions of Visual Studio with the Microsoft C++ compiler are
not supported, and most likely will not be, as these compilers are
deficient in their support for ISO C++.


Intel C++ for Windows
---------------------

Intel C++ 7.0 and later is known to compile earlier versions of OpenEXR.
It should be able to compile the 1.1.0 release of OpenEXR as well.
However, we have not tested it.  

Also, if you are using Visual Studio 6 with the Intel C++ compiler, 
we have not yet updated the Visual Studio 6 project files for this
release.  We would gladly accept any community efforts to update these
files (we simply haven't had time yet).  We do expect to support this
environment again in the next release.


Fragment shader version of exrdisplay
-------------------------------------

The fragment shader version of exrdisplay does not yet handle offset
display windows correctly.  We will fix this in the next release.
