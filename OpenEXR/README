ABOUT THE OPENEXR LIBRARIES
----------------------------

Half is a class that encapsulates our 16-bit floating-point format.

IlmImf is our "EXR" file format for storing 16-bit FP images.

Imath is a math library.  IlmImf only uses a subset of it,
but we're releasing the full library because it's easier for us to 
maintain, and we think it'll be useful to others.

Iex is an exception-handling library.

Documentation on all of these libraries is incomplete.  See the .h files
for API details.  Most of the interfaces are well-documented from
a programmer's perspective.  See the IlmImfExamples directory for
some code that demonstrates how to use the IlmImf library to read
and write OpenEXR files.  The doc directory contains some high-level
documentation and history about the OpenEXR format.

LICENSE
-------

The OpenEXR source code distribution is free software.  See the file
named COPYING (included in this distribution) for details.


WHAT'S INCLUDED
---------------

Besides the core OpenEXR libraries, the release includes several 
utilities for reading, writing, viewing, and manipulating OpenEXR 
images.  These include:

  * exrdisplay, an image viewer.
  * exrheader, a utility for dumping header information.
  * exrstdattr, a utility for modifying OpenEXR standard attributes.
  * exrmaketiled, for generating tiled and rip/mipmapped images.
  * exrenvmap, for creating OpenEXR environment maps.
  * exrmakepreview, for creating preview images for OpenEXR files.

exrdisplay requires FLTK 1.1 or greater and OpenGL.  exrdisplay now
supports fragment shaders if you have the Nvidia Cg SDK and a graphics
card capable of running fp30 profile fragment shaders.  See
exrdisplay/README for details.

We have also released an OpenEXR display driver for Renderman, a file I/O
plugin for Shake, and a file I/O plugin for Adobe Photoshop (on both 
Windows and MacOS).  These are packaged separately.  Go to 
http://www.openexr.com to download them.



BUILDING OPENEXR
----------------

To build OpenEXR on GNU/Linux or other UNIX-like systems, do:

./configure
make
make install

If you have the Nvidia Cg SDK and you want to build support for
fragment shaders into exrdisplay, specify the path to the SDK using
the "--with-nvsdk-prefix" flag.

See README.OSX for details on building OpenEXR in MacOS X.

Do 'make check' to run confidence tests.  See the INSTALL file for more
details or try "./configure --help".

Other UNIX variants haven't been tested, but should be easy to build.
Let us know if you're having problems porting OpenEXR to a particular
platform.  See below for platform-specific notes.

All include files needed to use the OpenEXR libraries are installed in the 
OpenEXR subdirectory of the install prefix, e.g. /usr/local/include/OpenEXR.

To build OpenEXR on Windows NT or greater, you have a few choices:

  * Use Cygwin and the 'configure' script, see above.
  * Use Visual Studio .NET 2003 (version 7.1) with Microsoft's C++ compiler.

See README.win32 for details.
