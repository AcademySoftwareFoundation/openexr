The OpenEXR distribution is covered by a modified BSD license; see
the file named COPYING (included in this distribution) for details.

The release includes exrdisplay, an image viewer for OpenEXR images.  
It requires FLTK 1.1 or greater and OpenGL.


About the OpenEXR libraries:

Half is a class that encapsulates our 16-bit floating-point format.

IlmImf is our "EXR" file format for storing 16-bit FP images.

Imath is a math library.  IlmImf only uses a subset of it,
but we're releasing the full library because it's easier for us to 
maintain, and we think it'll be useful to others.

Iex is an exception-handling library.

Documentation on all of these libraries is incomplete.  See the .h files
for API details.  Most of the interfaces are well-documented from
a programmer's perspective.  See the source for the exrdisplay image
viewer for examples on how to use IlmImf and Half.  The doc directory
contains some high-level documentation and history about the OpenEXR
format.

To build OpenEXR on GNU/Linux or other UNIX-like systems, do:

./configure
make
make install

See below for notes on compiling OpenEXR in OS X.

Do 'make check' to run confidence tests.  See the INSTALL file for more
details or try "./configure --help".

Other UNIX variants haven't been tested, but should be easy to build.
Let us know if you're having problems porting OpenEXR to a particular
platform.  See below for platform-specific notes.

All include files needed to use the OpenEXR libraries are installed in the 
OpenEXR subdirectory of the install prefix, e.g. /usr/local/include/OpenEXR.

To build OpenEXR on Windows NT or greater, you can either use Cygwin
and the 'configure' script, or you can use Visual C++ 6.0 with Intel's
C++ compiler.  See README.win32 for details.


PLATFORM-SPECIFIC NOTES
-----------------------

OS X with Apple developer tools:

Short story: to work around some issues we're having with OpenEXR
on OS X right now, build OpenEXR like so:

./configure --enable-osx-istream-hack --enable-shared=no
make
make install

Long story:

We've only tested OpenEXR with OS X 10.2 (Jaguar).  It may work with
the version of gcc 3.1 distributed with the April 2002 developer tools 
on earlier versions of OS X, but we don't plan on supporting them.  You'll
probably have a tough time getting OpenEXR to work with gcc 2.95.2 on OS X
due to lack of sstream, among other things.

There appears to be a bug in Apple's istream::read implementation
as of OS X 10.2.3 and the December 2002 developer tools.  We
have a (hacky) workaround for it; to enable it, you must run 
configure with the --enable-osx-istream-hack option.  At the moment,
OpenEXR won't work on OS X without it.  See README.OSX for details.

OpenEXR doesn't support shared libs on OS X yet, either.  You can
build them, but you may have problems linking them into applications.


OS X with Metrowerks CodeWarrior:

There is a separate distribution which contains project files for
Metrowerks' CodeWarior compiler on OS X.  The istream hack described
above isn't necessary with CW.  Go to our downloads page to obtain the
CW project files:
