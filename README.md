# OpenEXR

<img align="right" src="docs/images/windowExample1.png">

OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the
EXR file format, the professional-grade image storage format of the
motion picture industry.

The purpose of EXR format is to accurately and efficiently represent
high-dynamic-range scene-linear image data and associated metadata,
with strong support for multi-part, multi-channel use cases.

OpenEXR is widely used in host application software where accuracy is
critical, such as photorealistic rendering, texture access, image
compositing, deep compositing, and DI.
