# Contributing to OpenEXR

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenEXR. This document
explains our contribution process and procedures

## Getting Information

There are two primary ways to connect with the OpenEXR project:

* The [openexr-dev](https://lists.aswf.io/g/openexr-dev) mail list:
This is a development focused mail list with a deep history of
technical conversations and decisions that have shaped the project.

* [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/openexr/openexr/issues): GitHub
**issues** are used both to track bugs and to discuss feature requests.

### How to Ask for Help

If you have trouble installing, building, or using the library, but there's not yet reason to suspect you've encountered a genuine bug, start by posting a question to the [openexr-dev](http://lists.aswf.io/openexr-dev) mailing list. This is the place for question such has "How do I...".

### How to Report a Bug

OpenEXR use GitHub's issue tracking system for bugs and enhancements:
https://github.com/openexr/openexr/issues

If you are submitting a bug report, please be sure to note which
version of OpenEXR you are using, on what platform (OS/version, which
compiler you used, and any special build flags or other unusual
environmental issues). Please give a specific account of

* what you tried
* what happened
* what you expected to happen instead

with enough detail that others can reproduce the problem.

### How to Request a Change

Open a GitHub issue: https://github.com/openexr/openexr/issues.

Describe the situation and the objective in as much detail as
possible. Feature requests will almost certainly spawn a discussion
among the project community.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you think you've found a potential vulnerability in OpenEXR, please
report it by emailing security@openexr.com. Only TSC members and ASWF
project management have access to these messages. Include detailed
steps to reproduce the issue, and any other information that could aid
an investigation.

### How to Contribute a Bug Fix or Change

To contribute code to the project, you'll need:

* A good knowledge of git.
* A fork of the GitHub repo.
* An understanding of the project's development workflow
* Legal Authorization

See below for details.

## Legal Requirements

OpenEXR is owned by the Academy Software Foundation and follows the
open source software best practice policies of the Linux Foundation.

### Contributor License Agreements

Developers who wish to contribute code to be considered for inclusion
in the OpenEXR distribution must first complete a **Contributor
License Agreement**.

Trivial changes (such as an alteration to the Makefiles, a one-line
bug fix, etc.) may be accepted without a CLA, at the sole discretion of the
project leader, but anything complex requires a CLA. 

* If you are an individual writing the code on your own time and
you're SURE you are the sole owner of any intellectual property you
contribute, use the [Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.openexr.com/downloads/OpenEXRIndividualContributorLicenseAgreement.docx).

* If you are writing the code as part of your job, or if there is any
possibility that your employers might think they own any intellectual
property you create, then you should use the [Corporate Contributor
Licence Agreement](http://www.openexr.com/downloads/OpenEXRCorporateContributorLicenseAgreement.docx).

Download the appropriate CLA from the links above (or find them in the
src/doc directory of the software distribution), print, sign, and
rescan it (or just add a digital signature directly), and email it
back to us at [info@openexr.com](info@openexr.com).

The OpenEXR CLA's are the standard forms used by Linux Foundation
projects.

### Commit Sign-Off

Every commit must be signed off.  That is, every commit log message
must include a “`Signed-off-by`” line (generated, for example, with
“`git commit --signoff`”), indicating that the committer wrote the
code and has the right to release it under the
[Modified-BSD-3-Clause](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)
license. See http://developercertificate.org/ for more information on
this requirement.

## Development Workflow

### Git Basics

Working with OpenEXR requires understanding a significant amount of
Git and GitHub based terminology. If you’re unfamiliar with these
tools or their lingo, please look at the [GitHub
Glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) or browse
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/).

To contribute, you need a GitHub account. This is needed in order to
push changes to the upstream repository, via a pull request.

You will also need Git installed on your local development machine. If
you need setup assistance, please see the official [Git
Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).

### Repository Structure and Commit Policy

The OpenEXR repository uses a simple branching and merging strategy.

All development work is done directly on the master branch. The master
branch represents the bleeding-edge of the project and most
contributions should be done on top of it.

After sufficient work is done on the master branch and the OpenEXR
leadership determines that a release is due, we will bump the relevant
internal versioning and tag a commit with the corresponding version
number, e.g. v2.0.1. Each Minor version also has its own “Release
Branch”, e.g. RB-1.1. This marks a branch of code dedicated to that
Major.Minor version, which allows upstream bug fixes to be
cherry-picked to a given version while still allowing the master
branch to continue forward onto higher versions. This basic repository
structure keeps maintenance low, while remaining simple to understand.

To reiterate, the master branch represents the latest development
version, so beware that it may include untested features and is not
generally stable enough for release.  To retrieve a stable version of
the source code, use one of the release branches.

### The Git Workflow

This development workflow is sometimes referred to as
[OneFlow](https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow). It
leads to a simple, clean, linear edit history in the repo.

The OpenEXR GitHub repo allows rebase merging and disallows merge
commits and squash merging. This ensures that the repo edit history
remains linear, avoiding the "bubbles" characteristic of the
[GitFlow](https://www.endoflineblog.com/gitflow-considered-harmful)
workflow.

### Use the Fork, Luke.

In a typical workflow, you should **fork** the OpenEXR repository to
your account. This creates a copy of the repository under your user
namespace and serves as the “home base” for your development branches,
from which you will submit **pull requests** to the upstream
repository to be merged.

Once your Git environment is operational, the next step is to locally
**clone** your forked OpenEXR repository, and add a **remote**
pointing to the upstream OpenEXR repository. These topics are
covered in the GitHub documentation [Cloning a
repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
and [Configuring a remote for a
fork](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/),
but again, if you need assistance feel free to reach out on the
openexr-dev@lists.aswf.io mail list.

### Pull Requests

Contributions should be submitted as Github pull requests. See
[Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
if you're unfamiliar with this concept. 

The development cycle for a code change should follow this protocol:

1. Create a topic branch in your local repository, following the naming format
"feature/<your-feature>" or "bugfix/<your-fix>".

2. Make changes, compile, and test thoroughly. Code style should match existing
style and conventions, and changes should be focused on the topic the pull
request will be addressing. Make unrelated changes in a separate topic branch
with a separate pull request.

3. Push commits to your fork.

4. Create a Github pull request from your topic branch.

5. Pull requests will be reviewed by project Committers and Contributors,
who may discuss, offer constructive feedback, request changes, or approve
the work.

6. Upon receiving the required number of Committer approvals (as
outlined in [Required Approvals](#required-approvals)), a Committer
other than the PR contributor may merge changes into the master
branch.

### Code Review and Required Approvals

Modifications of the contents of the OpenEXR repository are made on a
collaborative basis. Anyone with a GitHub account may propose a
modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project
Committers.

Pull requests must meet a minimum number of Committer approvals prior
to being merged. Rather than having a hard rule for all PRs, the
requirement is based on the complexity and risk of the proposed
changes, factoring in the length of time the PR has been open to
discussion. The following guidelines outline the project's established
approval rules for merging:

* Core design decisions, large new features, or anything that might be
perceived as changing the overall direction of the project should be
discussed at length in the mail list before any PR is submitted, in
order to: solicit feedback, try to get as much consensus as possible,
and alert all the stakeholders to be on the lookout for the eventual
PR when it appears.

* Small changes (bug fixes, docs, tests, cleanups) can be approved and
merged by a single Committer.

* Big changes that can alter behavior, add major features, or present
a high degree of risk should be signed off by TWO Committers, ideally
one of whom should be the "owner" for that section of the codebase (if
a specific owner has been designated). If the person submitting the PR
is him/herself the "owner" of that section of the codebase, then only
one additional Committer approval is sufficient. But in either case, a
48 hour minimum is helpful to give everybody a chance to see it,
unless it's a critical emergency fix (which would probably put it in
the previous "small fix" category, rather than a "big feature").

* Escape valve: big changes can nonetheless be merged by a single
Committer if the PR has been open for over two weeks without any
unaddressed objections from other Committers. At some point, we have
to assume that the people who know and care are monitoring the PRs and
that an extended period without objections is really assent.

Approval must be from Committers who are not authors of the change. If
one or more Committers oppose a proposed change, then the change
cannot be accepted unless:

* Discussions and/or additional changes result in no Committers
objecting to the change. Previously-objecting Committers do not
necessarily have to sign-off on the change, but they should not be
opposed to it.

* The change is escalated to the TSC and the TSC votes to approve the
change.  This should only happen if disagreements between Committers
cannot be resolved through discussion.

Committers may opt to elevate significant or controversial
modifications to the TSC by assigning the `tsc-review` label to a pull
request or issue. The TSC should serve as the final arbiter where
required.

### Project Issue Handling Process

Incoming new issues are labeled promptly by the TSC using GitHub labels. 

The labels include:

* **Bug** - A bug in the source code. Something appears to be
    functioning improperly: a compile error, a crash, unexpected behavior, etc. 

* **Build/Install Issue** - A problem with building or installing the
    library: configuration file, external dependency, a compile error
    with a release version that prevents installation.

* **C++** - A C++ compilation issue: a compiler warning, syntax issue,
    or language usage or suggested upgrade.

* **CMake** - A build issue with the CMake configuration files.

* **CVE** - A security vulnerability bug.

* **Documentation** - The project documentation: developer or user guide, web site, project policies, etc. 

* **Feature Request** - A suggested change or addition of functionality to the library.

* **MinGW** - An issue specific to MinGW

* **Mac OS** - A build issue specific to Mac OS.

* **Pending merge to master**

* **Question/Problem/Help** - A request for help or further investigation, possibly just user error or misunderstanding.

* **Test Failure** - One of the automated tests is failing, or an analysis tool is reporting problematic behavior.

* **Windows** - A build issue specific to Windows

* **Won't Fix** - No further action will taken.

## Coding Style

#### Formatting

TBD

#### File conventions

C++ implementation should be named `*.cpp`. Headers should be named `.h`.
All headers should contain

    #pragma once

#### Copyright Notices

All new source files should begin with a copyright and license stating:

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: Modified-BSD-3-Clause
    // Copyright Contributors to the OpenEXR Project. See LICENSE file for details.

#### Identifiers

In general, classes and templates should start with upper case and
capitalize new words: `class CustomerList;` In general, local
variables should start with lower case. Macros should be `ALL_CAPS`,
if used at all.

#### Third-party libraries

Prefer C++11 `std` over Boost where possible. Feel free to use Boost
classes you already see in the code base, but check with the project
leadership before adding new boost usage.

#### Comments and Doxygen

Comment philosophy: try to be clear, try to help teach the reader what's
going on in your code.

Prefer C++ comments (starting line with `//`) rather than C comments (`/* ... */`).

For public APIs, use Doxygen-style comments (start with `///`), such as:

    /// Explanation of a class.  Note THREE slashes!
    /// Also, you need at least two lines like this.  If you don't have enough
    /// for two lines, make one line blank like this:
    ///
    class myclass {
        ....
        float foo;  ///< Doxygen comments on same line look like this
    }

#### Miscellaneous

Macros should be used only rarely -- prefer inline functions, templates,
enums, or "const" values wherever possible.

Prefer `std::unique_ptr` over raw new/delete.

#### Bottom Line

When in doubt, look elsewhere in the code base for examples of similar
structures and try to format your code in the same manner, or ask on
the openexr-dev mail list.

## Release Management

### Versioning Policy

OpenEXR uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org), which labels
each version with three numbers: Major.Minor.Patch, where:

* **MAJOR** indicates incompatible API changes
* **MINOR** indicates functionality added in a backwards-compatible manner
* **PATCH** indicates backwards-compatible bug fixes
