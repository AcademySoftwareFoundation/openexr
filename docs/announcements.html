			<p><strong>November 25, 2013</strong> - OpenEXR v2.1.0 has been released and is available for download. 
				This release includes the following components (version locked):
				<ul>
					<li>OpenEXR: v2.1.0</li>
					<li>IlmBase: v2.1.0</li>
					<li>PyIlmBase: v2.1.0</li>

			</p>

			<p>This release includes a refactoring of the optimised read paths for RGBA data, optimisations

				additional documentation describing deep data in more detail.
			</p>

			<p><strong>April 9, 2013</strong> - Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and Weta Digital announce the release of 
				OpenEXR 2.0, the major version update of the open source high dynamic range file format first 
				introduced by ILM and maintained and expanded by a number of key industry leaders including 
				Weta Digital, Pixar Animation Studios, Autodesk and others.
			</p>

			<p>The release includes a number of new features that align with the major version number increase. 
				Amongst the major improvements are:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li><strong>Deep Data support</strong> - Pixels can now store a variable-length list of samples. 
					The main rationale behind deep images is to enable the storage of multiple values at different 
					depths for each pixel. OpenEXR 2.0 supports both hard-surface and volumetric representations 
					for Deep Compositing workflows.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Multi-part Image Files</strong> - With OpenEXR 2.0, files can now contain a number 
					of separate, but related, data parts in one file. Access to any part is independent of 
					the others, pixels from parts that are not required in the current operation don't need 
					to be accessed, resulting in quicker read times when accessing only a subset of channels. 
					The multipart interface also incorporates support for Stereo images where views are stored 
					in separate parts. This makes stereo OpenEXR 2.0 files significantly faster to work with 
					than the previous multiview support in OpenEXR.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Optimized pixel reading</strong> - decoding RGB(A) scanline images has been accelerated 
					on SSE processors providing a significant speedup when reading both old and new format images, 
					including multipart and multiview files.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Namespacing</strong> - The library introduces versioned namespaces to avoid conflicts 
					between packages compiled with different versions of the library.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Although OpenEXR 2.0 is a major version update, files created by the new library that don't exercise 
				the new feature set are completely backwards compatible with previous versions of the library. By using 
				the OpenEXR 2.0 library, performance improvements, namespace versions and basic multi-part/deep reading 
				support should be available to applications without code modifications.
			</p>

			<p>This code is designed to support Deep Compositing - a revolutionary compositing workflow developed 
				at Weta Digital that detached the rendering of different elements in scene.  In particular, changes 
				in one layer could be rendered separately without the need to re-render other layers that would be 
				required to handle holdouts in a traditional comp workflow or sorting of layers in complex scenes 
				with elements moving in depth.  Deep Compositing became the primary compositing workflow on Avatar 
				and has seen wide industry adoption.  The technique allows depth and color value to be stored for 
				every pixel in a scene allowing for much more efficient handling of large complex scenes and greater 
				freedom for artists to iterate.
			</p>

			<p>True to the open source ethos, a number of companies contributed to support the format and encourage 
				adoption.  Amongst others, Pixar Animation Studios has contributed its DtexToExr converter to the 
				OpenEXR repository under a Microsoft Public License, which clears any concerns about existing 
				patents in the area, and Autodesk provided performance optimizations geared towards real-time 
				post-production workflows.
			</p>

			<p>Extensive effort has been put in ensuring all requirements were met to help a wide adoption, 
				staying true to the wide success of OpenEXR. Many software companies were involved in the beta 
				cycle to insure support amongst a number of industry leading applications. Numerous packages like 
				SideFX's Houdini, Autodesk's Maya,  Solid Angle's Arnold renderer, Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open 
				Image IO have already announced their support of the format.
			</p>

			<p>Open EXR 2.0 is an important step in the adoption of deep compositing as it provides a consistent 
				file format for deep data that is easy to read and work with throughout a visual effects pipeline.  
				The Foundry has build OpenEXR 2.0 support into its Nuke Compositing application as the base for the 
				Deep Compositing workflows.
			</p>

			<p>OpenEXR 2.0 is already in use at both Weta Digital and Industrial Light & Magic. ILM took advantage 
				of the new format on Marvel's The Avengers and two highly anticipated summer 2013 releases, 
				Pacific Rim and The Lone Ranger.  Recent examples of Weta Digital's use of the format also include 
				<em>Marvel's Avengers</em> as well as <em>Prometheus</em> and <em>The Hobbit</em>.  In addition, a 
				large number of visual effects studios have already integrated a deep workflow into their compositing
				pipelines or are in the process of doing so including:, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Pixar Animation 
				Studios, Rhythm & Hues, Fuel and MPC.
			</p>

			<p>In addition to visual effects, the new additions to the format, means that depth data can also be 
				assigned to two-dimensional data for a use in many design fields including, architecture, graphic 
				design, automotive and product prototyping.
			</p>

			<p>---</p>

			<p><strong>July 31st, 2012</strong> - OpenEXR v1.7.1 has been released and is available for download. This release 
				includes the following components:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>  OpenEXR: v1.7.1</li>
				<li>  IlmBase: v1.0.3</li>
				<li>  PyIlmBase: v1.0.0 (introduces a Boost dependency)</li>
				<li>  OpenEXR_Viewers: v1.0.2</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Of particular note is the introduction of PyIlmBase. This module forms a comprehensive set of python 
				bindings to the IlmBase module.
			</p>

			<p>In addition, contained in this release is a number of additions to Imath as well as a minor tweak 
				to Imath::Frustrum (for better support for Windows platforms) as well as other minor fixes, including 
				correction for soname version of IlmImf.
			</p>

			<p>---</p>

			<p><strong>June 18, 2012</strong> - We're pleased to announce the first public Beta release of OpenEXR v2.</p>
			
			<p>Development of OpenEXR v2 has been undertaken in a collaborative environment (cf. previous 
				<b>github</b> announcement) comprised of Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital as well as a number 
				of other contributors.
			</p>
			
			<p>Some of the new features included in the Beta.1 release of OpenEXR v2 are:</p>
			<p>* Deep Data. Pixels can now store a variable length list of samples.  The main rationale behind 
				deep-images is to have multiple values at different depths for each pixel. OpenEXR v2 supports both 
				hard surface and volumetric representation requirements for deep compositing workflows.
			</p>
			
			<p>* Multi-part image files. With OpenEXR v2, files can now contain a number of separate, but related, 
				images in one file. Access to any part is independent of the others; in particular, no access of 
				data need take place for unrequested parts.
			</p>
			
			<p>In addition, OpenEXR v2 also contains platform independent mechanisms for handling co-existing 
				library version conflicts in the same process space. (Currently implemented in IlmImf)
			</p>
			
			<p>Finally, a reminder that this is a Beta release and potentially incompatible changes may be 
			introduced in future releases prior to the v2.0.0 production version.

			<p><strong>January 22, 2007</strong> - CTL has been released.
			
				The Color Transformation Language, or CTL, is a programming language
				for digital color management.  Color management requires translating
				images between different representations or color spaces.  CTL allows
				users to describe color transforms in a concise and unambiguous way
				by expressing them as programs.  In order to apply a given transform
				to an image, a color management system instructs a CTL interpreter to
				load and run the CTL program that describes the transform.
		
				The image viewers included in the OpenEXR software distribution,
				exrdisplay and playexr, both support color rendering via CTL.
				For more information see <a href="http://www.openexr.com/OpenEXRViewers.pdf">
				http://www.openexr.com/OpenEXRViewers.pdf</a>.
		
				Source code and documentation for the CTL interpreter can be
				downloaded from <a href="http://ampasctl.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">
				http://ampasctl.sourceforge.net</a>.  Please note
				the license under which CTL is distributed; it is similar but
				not identical to the OpenEXR license.

			<p><strong>December 15, 2006</strong> - A new development version of OpenEXR is now available.
				We have tested the code in this version internally at ILM, but we would
				like to get feedback from others before we release a production version.

				The new version includes several significant changes:
				<ul>
					<li>OpenEXR supports a new image compression method, called B44.  It has
						a fixed compression rate of 2.28:1, or 4.57:1 if used in combination
						with luminance/chroma encoding.  B44-compressed images can be
						uncompressed fast enough to support real-time playback of image
						sequences.
					</li>
					
					<li>The new playexr program plays back moving image sequences.  Playexr
						is multi-threaded and utilizes the threading capabilities of the IlmImf
						library that were introduced in OpenEXR 1.3.0.  The program plays back
						B44-compressed images with fairly high-resolution in real time on
						commodity hardware.
					</li>

					<li>The playexr program and a new version of the existing exrdisplay image
						viewer both support color rendering via color transforms written in
						the new Color Transformation Language or CTL. CTL is not part of OpenEXR; 
						it will be released separately. CTL support in playexr and exrdisplay is optional; 
						the programs can be built and will run without CTL.
					</li>

					<li>In preparation for the release of CTL, OpenEXR has been split into
						three separate packages:
					</li>
					
					<ul>
						<li>IlmBase 0.9.0 includes the Half, Iex, Imath and IlmThread libraries

						<li>OpenEXR 1.5.0 includes the IlmImf library, programming examples
							and utility programs such as exrheader or exrenvmap

						<li>OpenEXRViewers 0.9.0 includes the playexr and exrdisplay programs
					</ul>

					<li>The "Technical Introduction to OpenEXR" document now includes a
						recommendation for storing CIE XYZ pixel data in OpenEXR files.
					</li>

					<li>A new "OpenEXR Image Viewing Software" document describes the
						playexr and exrdisplay programs.  It briefly explains real-time
						playback and color rendering, and includes recommendations for
						testing if other image viewing software displays OpenEXR images
						correctly.
					</li>

					<li>The OpenEXR sample image set now includes B44-compressed files and
						files with CIE XYZ pixel data.
				   </li>
				   
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>---</p>

			<p><strong>August 8, 2006</strong> - We have released an updated set of sample OpenEXR
				images.  This release includes several new images that are useful
				for testing OpenEXR applications.  The images are organized by
				subdirectory according to their image type or purpose.  Several
				of these subdirectories contain README files that explain the
				contents of the images in those subdirectories.
			</p>
			
			<p>---</p>

			<p><strong>August 2, 2006</strong> - OpenEXR 1.4.0 is now available.  This is the next
				major production-ready release of OpenEXR and offers full compatibility
				with our last production release, which was 1.2.2.  This version
				obsoletes versions 1.3.x, which were test versions for 1.4.0.
				If you have been using 1.3.x, please upgrade to 1.4.0.
			</p>
			
			<p>---</p>

			<p><strong>June 8, 2006</strong> - OpenEXR 1.3.0 is now available.  This is
				a test release.  The major new feature in this version is
				support for multithreaded file I/O.  We've been testing
				the threaded code internally at ILM for a few months, and
				we have not encountered any bugs, but we'd like to get some
				feedback from others before we release the production version.
	
				Here's a summary of the changes since version 1.2.2:
					 
				<ul>
					<li>Support for multithreaded file reading and writing.
					<li>Support for Intel-based OS X systems.
					<li>Support for Visual Studio 2005.
					<li>Better handling of PLATFORM_* and HAVE_* macros.
					<li>Updated documentation.
					<li>Bug fixes related to handling of incomplete and
						damaged files.
					<li>Numerous bug fixes and cleanups to the autoconf-based
						build system.
					<li>Removed support for the following configurations that
						were previously supported.  Some of these configurations
						may happen to continue to function, but we can't help
						you if they don't, largely because we don't have any
						way to test them:
						<ul>
							<li>IRIX
							<li>OSF1
							<li>SunOS
							<li>OS X versions prior to 10.3.
							<li>gcc on any platform prior to version 3.3
					   </ul>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p><strong>March 15, 2005</strong> - We're pleased to announce the release of OpenEXR 1.2.2.  This is a relatively minor update to the project, with the following changes:

				<ul>
					<li>New build system for Windows; support for DLLs.
					<li>Switched documentation from HTML to PDF format.
					<li>IlmImf: support for image layers in ChannelList.
					<li>IlmImf: added isComplete() method to file classes to check
						whether a file is complete.
					</li>
					<li>IlmImf: exposed staticInitialize() in ImfHeader.h in
						order to allow thread-safe library initialization in
						multithreaded applications.
					</li>
					<li>IlmImf: New "time code" standard attribute.
					<li>exrdisplay: support for displaying wrap-around texture map images.
					<li>exrmaketiled: can now specify wrap mode.
					<li>IlmImf: New "wrapmodes" standard attribute to indicate
						extrapolation mode for mipmaps and ripmaps.
					</li>
					<li>IlmImf: New "key code" standard attribute to identify motion
						picture film frames.
					</li>
					<li>Imath: Removed TMatrix&lt;T&gt; classes; these classes are still
						under development and are too difficult to keep in sync
						with OpenEXR CVS.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p><strong>August 10, 2004</strong> - ILM's OpenEXR color management proposal,
				presented at the Siggraph 2004 "OpenEXR, Film and Color"
				Birds of a Feather meeting, is now available online.
				See the documentation section.
			</p>
			<p>---</p>

			<p><strong>June 6, 2004</strong> - OpenEXR 1.2.1 is now available.  This is a fairly minor release,
				mostly just a few tweaks, a few bug fixes, and some new documentation.
				Here are the most important changes:

				<ul>
					<li>reduced memory footprint of exrenvmap and exrmaketiled
						utilities.
					</li>
					<li>IlmImf: new helper functions to determine whether a file
						is an OpenEXR file, and whether it's scanline- or
						tile-based.
					</li>
					<li>IlmImf: bug fix for PXR24 compression with ySampling != 1.
					</li>
					<li>Better support for gcc 3.4.
					</li>
					<li>Warning cleanups in Visual C++.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<p>---</p>

			<p><strong>May 11, 2004</strong> - OpenEXR 1.2.0 is now available.  This is the first official,
				production-ready release since OpenEXR 1.0.7.  If you have been using the
				development 1.1 series, please switch to 1.2.0 as soon as possible.

				We believe that OpenEXR 1.2.0 is ready for use in shipping applications.
				We have been using it in production at ILM for several months now with no
				problems.

				There are quite a few major new features in the 1.2 series as compared to the original 1.0 series:

				<ul>
					<li>Support for tiled images, including mipmaps and ripmaps.  Note that
						software based on the 1.0 series cannot read or write tiled images.
						However, simply by recompiling your software against the 1.2
						release, any code that reads scanline images can read tiled images,
						too.
					</li>

					<li>A new Pxr24 compressor, contributed by Pixar Animation Studios.
						Values produced by the Pxr24 compressor provide the same range
						as 32-bit floating-point numbers with slightly less precision,
						and compress quite a bit better.  The Pxr24 compressor stores UINT
						and HALF channels losslessly, and for these data types performs
						similarly to the ZIP compressor.
					</li>

					<li>OpenEXR now supports high dynamic-range YCA (luminance/chroma/alpha)
						images with subsampled chroma channels.  These files are supported
						via the RGBA convenience interface, so that data is presented to the
						application as RGB(A) but stored in the file as YC(A).  OpenEXR also
						supports Y and YA (black-and-white/black-and-white with alpha)
						images.
					</li>

					<li>An abstracted file I/O interface, so that you can use OpenEXR with
						interfaces other than C++'s iostreams.
					</li>

					<li>Several new utilities for manipulating tiled image files.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				See the <a href="downloads">downloads</a> section to download the source
				code and sample images.

			<p><strong>Mar 27, 2004</strong> - OpenEXR 1.1.1 is now available.  This another
				development release.  We expect to release a stable version, 1.2,
				around the end of April.  Version 1.1.1 includes support for PXR24
				compression, and for high-dynamic-range luminance/chroma images
				with subsampled chroma channels.  Version 1.1.1 also fixes a bug
				in the 1.1.0 tiled file format.
			</p>

			<p>---</p>

			<p><strong>Mar 27, 2004</strong> - We are pleased to announce that
				Pixar Animation Studios has contributed code to OpenEXR
				for a new lossy compression method, which compresses 32-bit
				floating-point data quite a bit better than OpenEXR's other
				compressors.  This new compressor is called PXR24 and is
				available as of the 1.1.1 development release of OpenEXR.
				It will also be included in the upcoming 1.2 stable release.
				Thanks to Loren Carpenter and Dana Batali of Pixar, for making
				this happen!
			</p>

			<p><strong>Feb 6, 2004</strong> - OpenEXR 1.1.0 is now available.  This is a major new release
				with support for tiled images, multi-resolution files (mip/ripmaps),
				environment maps, and abstracted file I/O.  We've also released a new set
				of images that demonstrate these features, and updated the CodeWarrior project and Photoshop 
				plugins for this release.  See the <a href="downloads">downloads</a> section for the source code 
				and the new images.
			</p>

			<p>---</p>

			<p><strong>Jan 8, 2004</strong> - Industrial Light & Magic has released the source code for an OpenEXR 
				Shake plugin. The plugin is supported on Shake 3.0 on the GNU/Linux and MacOS X platforms.  See the 
				<a href="downloads">downloads</a> section.
			</p>

			<p>---</p>

			<p><strong>Jan 7, 2004</strong> - OpenEXR 1.0.7 is now available.  In addition to some bug
				fixes, this version adds support for some new standard attributes, such as
				primary and white point chromaticities, lens aperture, film speed, image
				acquisition time and place, and more.  If you want to use these new
				attributes in your applications, see the ImfStandardAttributes.h header
				file for documentation.

				<p>Our project hosting site, Savannah, is still recovering from a compromise
					last month, so in the meantime, we're hosting file downloads <a
					href="downloads">here</a>.  Some of the files are not currently
					available, but we're working to restore them.
				</p>
			</p>
