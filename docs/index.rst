===============================

OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the
EXR file format, the professional-grade image storage format of the
motion picture industry.

The purpose of EXR format is to accurately and efficiently represent
high-dynamic-range scene-linear image data and associated metadata,
with strong support for multi-part, multi-channel use cases.

OpenEXR is widely used in host application software where accuracy is
critical, such as photorealistic rendering, texture access, image
compositing, deep compositing, and DI.

OpenEXR Features

* High dynamic range and color precision.
* Support for 16-bit floating-point, 32-bit floating-point, and
  32-bit integer pixels.
* Multiple image compression algorithms, both lossless and lossy. Some of
  the included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on images
  with film grain.  The lossy codecs have been tuned for visual quality and
  decoding performance.
* Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily be added
  by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR software distribution.
  New image attributes (strings, vectors, integers, etc.) can be added to
  OpenEXR image headers without affecting backward compatibility with
  existing OpenEXR applications. 
* Support for stereoscopic image workflows and a generalization
  to multi-views.
* Flexible support for deep data: pixels can store a variable-length list
  of samples and, thus, it is possible to store multiple values at different
  depths for each pixel. Hard surfaces and volumetric data representations
  are accommodated.
* Multipart: ability to encode separate, but related, images in one file.
  This allows for access to individual parts without the need to read other
  parts in the file.
* Versioning: OpenEXR source allows for user configurable C++
  namespaces to provide protection when using multiple versions of the
  library in the same process space.
