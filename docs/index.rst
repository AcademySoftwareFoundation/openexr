OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the
EXR file format, the professional-grade image storage format of the
motion picture industry.

The purpose of EXR format is to accurately and efficiently represent
high-dynamic-range scene-linear image data and associated metadata,
with strong support for multi-part, multi-channel use cases.

OpenEXR is widely used in host application software where accuracy is
critical, such as photorealistic rendering, texture access, image
compositing, deep compositing, and DI.

OpenEXR is a project of the `Academy Software Foundation
<https://www.aswf.io>`_.


Imath
-----

The OpenEXR project includes `Imath <https://imath.readthedocs.io>`_,
a basic, light-weight, and efficient C++ representation of 2D and 3D
vectors and matrices and other simple but useful mathematical objects,
functions, and data types common in computer graphics applications,
including the “half” 16-bit floating-point type.

Imath also includes optional python bindings for all types and
functions, including optimized implementations of vector and matrix
arrays.
