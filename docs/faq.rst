``pip install openexr`` doesn't work"
=====================================

  The OpenEXR project provides python bindings for the Imath
  vector/matrix classes, but it does *not* provide python bindings for
  reading, writing, or editing .exr files.  The `openexrpython
  <https://github.com/jamesbowman/openexrpython>`_ module is not
  affiliated with the OpenEXR project or the ASWF. Please direct
  questions there.

  Alternatively, `OpenImageIO
  <https://sites.google.com/site/openimageio/home>`_ also includes
  python bindings for OpenEXR.
