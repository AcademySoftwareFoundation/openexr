			<h1> OpenEXR <h2>
			<hr class="divider">
			<p>OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of
			the EXR file format, the professional-grade image storage format of
			the motion picture industry. The purpose of format is to accurately
			and efficiently represent high-dynamic-range scene-linear image data
			and associated metadata, with strong support for multi-part,
			multi-channel use cases. The library is widely used in host
			application software where accuracy is critical, such as
			photorealistic rendering, texture access, image compositing, deep
			compositing, and DI.</p>

			<p>OpenEXR a project of the <a href="https://www.aswf.io/"
			target="_blank">Academy Software Foundation</a> and is part of
			the <a href="https://vfxplatform.com/" target="_blank">VFX Reference
			Platform.</a> OpenEXR was originally developed by Industrial Light &
			Magic (ILM) and first released in 2003. Weta Digital, Walt Disney
			Animation Studios, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Pixar Animation Studios,
			DreamWorks, and other studios, companies, and individuals have made
			significant contributions to the code base.
			</p>

			<p><h3><a name="mission">Mission Statement</a></h3>

			<p>The goal of the OpenEXR project is to keep the format reliable and
			modern and to maintain its place as the preferred image format for
			entertainment content creation. Major revisions are infrequent, and
			new features will be carefully weighed against increased complexity.</p>

			<p>The principal priorities of the project are:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Robustness, reliability, security</li>
			<li>Backwards compatibility, data longevity</li>
			<li>Performance - read/write/compression/decompression time</li>
			<li>Simplicity, ease of use, maintainability</li>
			<li>Wide adoption, multi-platform support - Linux, Windows, macOS, and others</li>
			</ul>

			<p>OpenEXR is intended solely for 2D data. It is not appropriate for
			storage of volumetric data, cached or lit 3D scenes, or more complex
			3D data such as light fields.</p>

			<p>Also a part of OpenEXR, the IlmBase library is a basic, light-weight,
			and efficient representation of 2D and 3D vectors and matrices and
			other simple but useful mathematical objects, functions, and data
			types common in computer graphics applications, including the “half”
			16-bit floating-point type. The goal of the project is simplicity,
			ease of use, and breadth of adoption. It is not intended to be a
			comprehensive linear algebra or numerical analysis package.</p>

			<p><h3><a name="features">OpenEXR Features</a></h3>

			<p>OpenEXR's features include:

			<ul>

			<li>High dynamic range and color precision.</li>
			<li>Support for 16-bit floating-point, 32-bit floating-point, and 32-bit integer pixels.</li>
			<li>Multiple image compression algorithms, both lossless and lossy. Some of the included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on images with film grain. The lossy codecs have been tuned for visual quality and decoding performance.</li>
			<li>Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors, integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR applications.</li>
			<li>Support for stereoscopic image workflows and a generalization to multi-views.</li>
			<li>Flexible support for deep data: pixels can store a variable-length list of samples and, thus, it is possible to store multiple values at different depths for each pixel. Hard surfaces and volumetric data representations are accommodated.</li>
			<li>Multipart: ability to encode separate, but related, images in one file. This allows for access to individual parts without the need to read other parts in the file.</li>
			<li>Versioning: OpenEXR source allows for user configurable C++ namespaces to provide protection when using multiple versions of the library in the same process space.</li>

			</ul>

			<p>The OpenEXR software distribution includes:</p>

			<ul>
			  <li><i>IlmImf</i>, a library that reads and writes OpenEXR images.</li>
			  <li><i>IlmImfUtil</i>, a convenience library to simplify development of OpenEXR utilities.</li>
			  <li><i>Half</i>, a C++ class for manipulating half values as if they were a
			built-in C++ data type.</li>
			  <li><i>Imath</i>, a math library with support for matrices, 2d- and
			3d-transformations, solvers for linear/quadratic/cubic equations, and
			more.</li>
			  <li><i>exrdisplay</i>, a sample application for viewing OpenEXR images on a
			display at various exposure settings.</li>
			</ul>
