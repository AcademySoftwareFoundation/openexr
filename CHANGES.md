*  [Reverted python library -l line logic to go back to the old PYTHON_VERSION based logic.](https://github.com/openexr/openexr/commit/02310c624547fd765cd6e08abe459755d4ecebcc) ([Nick Rasmussen](@nick@ilm.com), 2018-08-09) 

*  [Updated build system to use local copies of the ax_cxx_copmile_stdcxx.m4 macro.](https://github.com/openexr/openexr/commit/3d6c9302b3d7f394a90ac3c95d12b1db1c183812) ([Nick Rasmussen](@nick@ilm.com), 2018-08-09) 

*  [accidentally commited Makefile instead of Makefile.am](https://github.com/openexr/openexr/commit/46dda162ef2b3defceaa25e6bdd2b71b98844685) ([Cary Phillips](@cary@ilm.com), 2018-08-09) 

*  [update CHANGES.md](https://github.com/openexr/openexr/commit/ea46c15be9572f81549eaa76a1bdf8dbe364f780) ([Cary Phillips](@cary@ilm.com), 2018-08-08) 

*  [Added FindNumPy.cmake](https://github.com/openexr/openexr/commit/63870bb10415ca7ea76ecfdafdfe70f5894f66f2) ([Nick Porcino](@meshula@hotmail.com), 2018-08-08) 

*  [Add PyImathNumpyTest to Makefile and configure.ac](https://github.com/openexr/openexr/commit/36abd2b728e8759b010ceffe94363d5f473fe6dc) ([Cary Phillips](@cary@ilm.com), 2018-08-08) 

*  [Add ImfExportUtil.h to Makefile.am](https://github.com/openexr/openexr/commit/82f78f4a895e29b42d2ccc0d66be08948203f507) ([Cary Phillips](@cary@ilm.com), 2018-08-08) 

*  [fix pyilmbase tests, static compilation](https://github.com/openexr/openexr/commit/75c918b65c2394c7f7a9f769fee87572d06e81b5) ([Kimball Thurston](@kdt3rd@gmail.com), 2018-08-09) - python extensions must be shared, so can not follow the overall lib type for the library. - the code should be compiled fPIC when building a static library such that it can be linked into a .so - remove the dependency on the particle python extension in the numpy test - add environment variables such that the python tests will work in the build tree without a "make install" (win32 doesn't neede ld_library_path, but it doesn't hurt, but may need path?) Signed-off-by: Kimball Thurston <kdt3rd@gmail.com> 

*  [fix OPENEXR_VERSION and OPENEXR_SOVERSION](https://github.com/openexr/openexr/commit/4481442b467e492a3a515b0992391dc160282786) ([Cary Phillips](@cary@ilm.com), 2018-08-08)

Even with this off by default, if building tests is enabled, the fuzz test will still be compiled, and is available to run via "make fuzz".

*  [Implement SIMD-accelerated ImfZip::uncompress](https://github.com/openexr/openexr/commit/32f2aa58fe4f6f6691eef322fdfbbc9aa8363f80) ([John Loy](@jloy@pixar.com), 2017-04-12) The main bottleneck in ImfZip::uncompress appears not to be zlib but the predictor & interleaving loops that run after zlib's decompression. Fortunately, throughput in both of these loops can be improved with SIMD operations. Even though each trip of the predictor loop has data dependencies on all previous values, the usual SIMD prefix-sum construction is able to provide a significant speedup. While the uses of SSSE3 and SSE4.1 are minor in this change and could maybe be replaced with some slightly more complicated SSE2, SSE4.1 was released in 2007, so it doesn't seem unreasonable to require it in 2017. 

*  [Compute sample locations directly in Imf::readPerDeepLineTable.](https://github.com/openexr/openexr/commit/e64095257a29f9bc423298ee8dbc09a317f22046) ([John Loy](@jloy@pixar.com), 2017-04-06) By changing the function to iterate over sample locations directly instead of discarding unsampled pixel positions, we can avoid computing a lot of modulos (more than one per pixel.) Even on modern x86 processors, idiv is a relatively expensive instruction. Though it may appear like this optimization could be performed by a sufficiently sophisticated compiler, gcc 4.8 does not get there (even at -O3.) 

*  [Manually hoist loop invariants in Imf::bytesPerDeepLineTable.](https://github.com/openexr/openexr/commit/71b8109a4ad123ef0d5783f01922463a16d2ca59) ([John Loy](@jloy@pixar.com), 2017-04-05) This is primarily done to avoid a call to pixelTypeSize within the inner loop. In particular, gcc makes the call to pixelTypeSize via PLT indirection so it may have arbitrary side-effects (i.e. ELF symbol interposition strikes again) and may not be moved out of the loop by the compiler. 

*  [Inline Imf::sampleCount; this is an ABI-breaking change.](https://github.com/openexr/openexr/commit/5aa0afd5a4f8df9e09d6461f115e6e0cec5cbe46) ([John Loy](@jloy@pixar.com), 2017-03-29) gcc generates calls to sampleCount via PLT indirection even within libIlmImf. As such, they are not inlined and must be treated as having arbitrary side effects (because of ELF symbol interposition.) Making addressing computations visible at call sites allows a much wider range of optimizations by the compiler beyond simply eliminating the function call overhead.

It's been deprecated in C++11, and therefore will generate warnings when encountered -- and many packages that use OpenEXR's public headers use -Werr to turn warnings into errors.

This allows you to read raw scan lines into an external buffer. It's similar to the existing function rawPixelData, but unlike this existing function it allows the user to control where the data will be stored instead of reading it into a local buffer. This means you can store multiple raw scan lines at once and enables the decompression of these scan lines to be done in parallel using an application's own threads.

## Version 2.0 (April 9, 2013)

Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and Weta Digital announce the release
of OpenEXR 2.0, the major version update of the open source high
dynamic range file format first introduced by ILM and maintained and
expanded by a number of key industry leaders including Weta Digital,
Pixar Animation Studios, Autodesk and others.

The release includes a number of new features that align with the
major version number increase. Amongst the major improvements are:

* **Deep Data support** - Pixels can now store a variable-length list of
  samples. The main rationale behind deep images is to enable the
  storage of multiple values at different depths for each
  pixel. OpenEXR 2.0 supports both hard-surface and volumetric
  representations for Deep Compositing workflows.

* **Multi-part Image Files** - With OpenEXR 2.0, files can now contain
  a number of separate, but related, data parts in one file. Access to
  any part is independent of the others, pixels from parts that are
  not required in the current operation don't need to be accessed,
  resulting in quicker read times when accessing only a subset of
  channels. The multipart interface also incorporates support for
  Stereo images where views are stored in separate parts. This makes
  stereo OpenEXR 2.0 files significantly faster to work with than the
  previous multiview support in OpenEXR.

* **Optimized pixel reading** - decoding RGB(A) scanline images has
  been accelerated on SSE processors providing a significant speedup
  when reading both old and new format images, including multipart and
  multiview files.

* **Namespacing** - The library introduces versioned namespaces to
  avoid conflicts between packages compiled with different versions of
  the library.

Although OpenEXR 2.0 is a major version update, files created by the
new library that don't exercise the new feature set are completely
backwards compatible with previous versions of the library. By using
the OpenEXR 2.0 library, performance improvements, namespace versions
and basic multi-part/deep reading support should be available to
applications without code modifications.

This code is designed to support Deep Compositing - a revolutionary
compositing workflow developed at Weta Digital that detached the
rendering of different elements in scene. In particular, changes in
one layer could be rendered separately without the need to re-render
other layers that would be required to handle holdouts in a
traditional comp workflow or sorting of layers in complex scenes with
elements moving in depth. Deep Compositing became the primary
compositing workflow on Avatar and has seen wide industry
adoption. The technique allows depth and color value to be stored for
every pixel in a scene allowing for much more efficient handling of
large complex scenes and greater freedom for artists to iterate.

True to the open source ethos, a number of companies contributed to
support the format and encourage adoption. Amongst others, Pixar
Animation Studios has contributed its DtexToExr converter to the
OpenEXR repository under a Microsoft Public License, which clears any
concerns about existing patents in the area, and Autodesk provided
performance optimizations geared towards real-time post-production
workflows.

Extensive effort has been put in ensuring all requirements were met to
help a wide adoption, staying true to the wide success of
OpenEXR. Many software companies were involved in the beta cycle to
insure support amongst a number of industry leading
applications. Numerous packages like SideFX's Houdini, Autodesk's
Maya, Solid Angle's Arnold renderer, Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open
Image IO have already announced their support of the format.

Open EXR 2.0 is an important step in the adoption of deep compositing
as it provides a consistent file format for deep data that is easy to
read and work with throughout a visual effects pipeline. The Foundry
has build OpenEXR 2.0 support into its Nuke Compositing application as
the base for the Deep Compositing workflows.

OpenEXR 2.0 is already in use at both Weta Digital and Industrial
Light & Magic. ILM took advantage of the new format on Marvel's The
Avengers and two highly anticipated summer 2013 releases, Pacific Rim
and The Lone Ranger. Recent examples of Weta Digital's use of the
format also include Marvel's Avengers as well as Prometheus and The
Hobbit. In addition, a large number of visual effects studios have
already integrated a deep workflow into their compositing pipelines or
are in the process of doing so including:, Sony Pictures Imageworks,
Pixar Animation Studios, Rhythm & Hues, Fuel and MPC.

In addition to visual effects, the new additions to the format, means
that depth data can also be assigned to two-dimensional data for a use
in many design fields including, architecture, graphic design,
automotive and product prototyping.

### Detailed Changes:

## Version 2.0.0.beta.1 (June 15, 2012)

Development of OpenEXR v2 has been undertaken in a collaborative
environment (cf. previous github announcement) comprised of Industrial
Light & Magic, Weta Digital as well as a number of other contributors.

Some of the new features included in the Beta.1 release of OpenEXR v2
are:

* **Deep Data** Pixels can now store a variable length list of
  samples. The main rationale behind deep-images is to have multiple
  values at different depths for each pixel. OpenEXR v2 supports both
  hard surface and volumetric representation requirements for deep
  compositing workflows.

* **Multi-part image files** With OpenEXR v2, files can now contain a
    number of separate, but related, images in one file. Access to any
    part is independent of the others; in particular, no access of
    data need take place for unrequested parts.

In addition, OpenEXR v2 also contains platform independent mechanisms
for handling co-existing library version conflicts in the same process
space. (Currently implemented in IlmImf)

Finally, a reminder that this is a Beta release and potentially
incompatible changes may be introduced in future releases prior to the
v2.0.0 production version.

Please read the separate file for v2 additions and changes.

### Detailed Changes:

* Added git specific files 
	  (Piotr Stanczyk)
* Updated the so verison to 20
	  (Piotr Stanczyk)
* Initial use of the CMake build system 
	  (Nicholas Yue)

## Version 1.7.1 (July 31, 2012)

This release includes the following components:

* OpenEXR: v1.7.1
* IlmBase: v1.0.3
* PyIlmBase: v1.0.0 (introduces a Boost dependency)
* OpenEXR_Viewers: v1.0.2

Of particular note is the introduction of PyIlmBase. This module forms
a comprehensive set of python bindings to the IlmBase module.

In addition, contained in this release is a number of additions to
Imath as well as a minor tweak to Imath::Frustrum (for better support
for Windows platforms) as well as other minor fixes, including
correction for soname version of IlmImf.

## Version 1.7.0 (July 23, 2010)

This release includes support for stereoscopic images, please see the
adjoining documentation in the ``MultiViewOpenEXR.pdf``. (Many thanks
to Weta Digital for their contribution.) In addition, we added support
for targeting 64 bit Windows, fixes for buffer overruns and a number
of other minor fixes, additions and optimisations. Please see the
Changelog files for more detailed information.

### Detailed Changes:

* Added support for targetting builds on 64bit Windows and minimising
  number of compiler warnings on Windows. Thanks to Ger Hobbelt for
  his contributions to CreateDLL.  (Ji Hun Yu)
          
* Added new atttribute types (Florian Kainz):
  * **M33dAttribute** 3x3 double-precision matrix
  * **M44dAttribute** 4x4 double-precision matrix
  * **V2d** 2D double-precision vector
  * **V3d** 3D double-precision vector  
	  
* Bug fix: crash when reading a damaged image file (found by Apple).
  An exception thrown inside the PIZ Huffman decoder bypasses
  initialization of an array of pointers.  The uninitialized pointers
  are later passed to operator delete.  (Florian Kainz)

* Bug fix: crash when reading a damaged image file (found by Apple).
  Computing the size of input certain buffers may overflow and wrap
  around to a small number, later causing writes beyond the end of the
  buffer.  (Florian Kainz)

* In the "Technical Introduction" document, added Premultiplied
  vs. Un-Premulitiplied Color section: states explicitly that pixels
  with zero alpha and non-zero RGB are allowed, points out that
  preserving such a pixel can be a problem in application programs
  with un-premultiplied internal image representations.  (Florian
  Kainz)

* exrenvmap improvements:

  - New command line flags set the type of the input image to
    latitude-longitude map or cube-face map, overriding the envmap
    attribute in the input file header.

  - Cube-face maps can now be assembled from or split into six
    square sub-images.

  - Converting a cube-face map into a new cube-face map with the same
    face size copies the image instead of resampling it.  This avoids
    blurring when a cube-face map is assembled from or split into
    sub-images.  (Florian Kainz)

* Updated standard chromaticities in ImfAcesFile.cpp to match final
  ACES (Academy Color Encoding Specification) document.  (Florian
  Kainz)

* Added worldToCamera and worldToNDC matrices to
  ImfStandardAttributes.h (Florian Kainz)

* Increased the maximum length of attribute and channel names from 31
  to 255 characters.  For files that do contain names longer than 31
  characters, a new LONG_NAMES_FLAG in the fil version number is set.
  This flag causes older versions of the IlmImf library (1.6.1 and
  earlier) to reject files with long names.  Without the flag, older
  library versions would mis-interpret files with long names as
  broken.  (Florian Kainz)

* Reading luminance/chroma-encoded files via the RGBA interface is
  faster: buffer padding avoids cache thrashing for certain image
  sizes, redundant calls to saturation() have been eliminated.  (Mike
  Wall)

* Added "hemispherical blur" option to exrenvmap.  (Florian Kainz)

* Added experimental version of I/O classes for ACES file format
  (restricted OpenEXR format with special primaries and white point);
  added exr2aces file converter.  (Florian Kainz)

* Added new constructors to classes Imf::RgbaInputFile and
  Imf::TiledRgbaInputFile.  The new constructors have a layerName
  parameter, which allows the caller to specify which layer of a
  multi-layer or multi-view image will be read.  (Florian Kainz)

* A number of member functions in classes Imf::Header,
  Imf::ChannelList and Imf::FrameBuffer have parameters of type "const
  char *".  Added equivalent functions that take "const std::string &"
  parameters.  (Florian Kainz)

* Added library support for Weta Digital multi-view images:
  StringVector attribute type, multiView standard attribute of type
  StringVector, utility functions related to grouping channels into
  separate views.  (Peter Hillman, Florian Kainz)

## Version 1.6.1 (October 22, 2007)

This release fixes a buffer overrun in OpenEXR and a Windows build
problem in CTL, and it removes a few unnecessary files from the
.tar.gz packages.

### Detailed Changes:

* Removed Windows .suo files from distribution.  (Eric Wimmer)

* Bug fix: crashes, memory leaks and file descriptor leaks when
  reading damaged image files (some reported by Apple, others found by
  running IlmImfFuzzTest).  (Florian Kainz)
          
* Added new IlmImfFuzzTest program to test how resilient the IlmImf
  library is with respect broken input files: the program first
  damages OpenEXR files by partially overwriting them with random
  data; then it tries to read the damaged files.  If all goes well,
  the program doesn't crash.  (Florian Kainz)

## Version 1.6.0 (August 3, 2007)

OpenEXR 1.6.0:

* Reduced generational loss in B44- and B44A-compressed images.

* Added B44A compression. This is a variation of B44, but with a
  better compression ratio for images with large uniform areas, such
  as in an alpha channel.

* Bug fixes.

CTL 1.4.0:

* Added new functions to the CTL standard library: 3x3 matrix support,
  1D lookup tables with cubic interpolation.

* Added new "ctlversion" statement to the language.

* Bug fixes.

OpenEXR_CTL 1.0.0:

* Applying CTL transforms to a frame buffer is multi-threaded.
Bug fixes.

OpenEXR_Viewers 1.0.0:

* Implemented new naming conventions for CTL parameters.

IlmBase 1.0.0:

* Half now implements "round to nearest even" mode.

### Detailed Changes:

* Bumped DSO version number to 6.0 (Florian Kainz)

* Added new standard attributes related to color rendering with CTL
  (Color Transformation Language): renderingTransform,
  lookModTransform and adoptedNeutral.  (Florian Kainz)

* Bug fix: for pixels with luminance near HALF_MIN, conversion from
  RGB to luminance/chroma produces NaNs and infinities (Florian Kainz)
          
* Bug fix: excessive desaturation of small details with certain colors
  after repeatedly loading and saving luminance/chroma encoded images
  with B44 compression.  (Florian Kainz)

* Added B44A compression, a minor variation of B44: in most cases, the
  compression ratio is 2.28:1, the same as with B44, but in uniform
  image areas where all pixels have the same value, the compression
  ratio increases to 10.66:1.  Uniform areas occur, for example, in an
  image's alpha channel, which typically contains large patches that
  are solid black or white, or in computer- generated images with a
  black background.  (Florian Kainz)

* Added flag to configure.ac to enable or disable use of large auto
  arrays in the IlmImf library.  Default is "enable" for Linux,
  "disable" for everything else.  (Darby Johnston, Florian Kainz)

* corrected version number on dso's (libtool) - now 5.0

* Separated ILMBASE_LDFLAGS and ILMBASE_LIBS so that test programs can
  link with static libraries properly

* eliminated some warning messages during install (Andrew Kunz)
	
## Version 1.5.0 (December 15, 2006)

The new version includes several significant changes:

* OpenEXR supports a new image compression method, called B44. It has
  a fixed compression rate of 2.28:1, or 4.57:1 if used in combination
  with luminance/chroma encoding. B44-compressed images can be
  uncompressed fast enough to support real-time playback of image
  sequences.

* The new playexr program plays back moving image sequences. Playexr
  is multi-threaded and utilizes the threading capabilities of the
  IlmImf library that were introduced in OpenEXR 1.3.0. The program
  plays back B44-compressed images with fairly high-resolution in real
  time on commodity hardware.

* The playexr program and a new version of the existing exrdisplay
  image viewer both support color rendering via color transforms
  written in the new Color Transformation Language or CTL. CTL is not
  part of OpenEXR; it will be released separately. CTL support in
  playexr and exrdisplay is optional; the programs can be built and
  will run without CTL.

* In preparation for the release of CTL, OpenEXR has been split into
  three separate packages:

  * IlmBase 0.9.0 includes the Half, Iex, Imath and IlmThread libraries

  * OpenEXR 1.5.0 includes the IlmImf library, programming examples and utility programs such as exrheader or exrenvmap

  * OpenEXRViewers 0.9.0 includes the playexr and exrdisplay programs

* The "Technical Introduction to OpenEXR" document now includes a
  recommendation for storing CIE XYZ pixel data in OpenEXR files.

* A new "OpenEXR Image Viewing Software" document describes the
  playexr and exrdisplay programs. It briefly explains real-time
  playback and color rendering, and includes recommendations for
  testing if other image viewing software displays OpenEXR images
  correctly.

* The OpenEXR sample image set now includes B44-compressed files and
  files with CIE XYZ pixel data.

### Detailed Changes:  

* reorganized packaging of OpenEXR libraries to facilitate integration
  with CTL.  Now this library depends on the library IlmBase.  Some
  functionality has been moved into OpenEXR_Viewers, which depends on
  two other libraries, CTL and OpenEXR_CTL.  Note: previously there
  were separate releases of OpenEXR-related plugins for Renderman,
  Shake and Photoshop.  OpenEXR is supported natively by Rendermand
  and Photoshop, so these plugins will not be supported for this or
  future versions of OpenEXR.  (Andrew Kunz)

* New build scripts for Linux/Unix (Andrew Kunz)

* New Windows project files and build scripts (Kimball Thurston)

* float-to-half conversion now preserves the sign of float zeroes and
  of floats that are so small that they become half zeroes.  (Florian
  Kainz)

* Bug fix: Imath::Frustum<T>::planes() returns incorrect planes if the
  frustum is orthogonal.  (Philip Hubbard)

* added new framesPerSecond optional standard attribute (Florian
  Kainz)

* Imath cleanup:

  - Rewrote function Imath::Quat<T>::setRotation() to make it
    numerically more accurate, added confidence tests

  - Rewrote function Imath::Quat<T>::slerp() using Don Hatch's method,
    which is numerically more accurate, added confidence tests.

  - Rewrote functions Imath::closestPoints(), Imath::intersect(),
    added confidence tests.

  - Removed broken function Imath::nearestPointOnTriangle().

  - Rewrote Imath::drand48(), Imath::lrand48(), etc. to make them
    functionally identical with the Unix/Linux versions of drand48(),
    lrand48() and friends.

  - Replaced redundant definitions of Int64 in Imath and IlmImf with a
    single definition in ImathInt64.h.  (Florian Kainz)

* exrdisplay: if the file's and the display's RGB chromaticities
  differ, the pixels RGB values are transformed from the file's to the
  display's RGB space.  (Florian Kainz)

* Added new lossy B44 compression method.  HALF channels are
  compressed with a fixed ratio of 2.28:1.  UINT and FLOAT channels
  are stored verbatim, without compression.  (Florian Kainz)

## Version 1.4.0a (August 9, 2006)

* Fixed the ReleaseDLL targets for Visual Studio 2003.  (Barnaby Robson)
	
## Version 1.4.0 (August 2, 2006)	

 This is the next major production-ready release of OpenEXR and offers
 full compatibility with our last production release, which was
 1.2.2. This version obsoletes versions 1.3.x, which were test
 versions for 1.4.0. If you have been using 1.3.x, please upgrade to
 1.4.0.

* Production release.

* Bug Fix: calling setFrameBuffer() for every scan line while reading
  a tiled file through the scan line API returns bad pixel data. (Paul
  Schneider, Florian Kainz)

## Version 1.3.1 (June 14, 2006)

* Fixed the ReleaseDLL targets for Visual Studio 2005.  (Nick Porcino, Drew Hess)

* Fixes/enhancements for createDLL.  (Nick Porcino)
	
## Version 1.3.0 (June 8, 2006)

This is a test release. The major new feature in this version is
support for multithreaded file I/O. We've been testing the threaded
code internally at ILM for a few months, and we have not encountered
any bugs, but we'd like to get some feedback from others before we
release the production version.

Here's a summary of the changes since version 1.2.2:

* Support for multithreaded file reading and writing.

* Support for Intel-based OS X systems.

* Support for Visual Studio 2005.

* Better handling of **PLATFORM_** and **HAVE_** macros.

* Updated documentation.

* Bug fixes related to handling of incomplete and damaged files.

* Numerous bug fixes and cleanups to the autoconf-based build system.

* Removed support for the following configurations that were
  previously supported. Some of these configurations may happen to
  continue to function, but we can't help you if they don't, largely
  because we don't have any way to test them:

  * IRIX
  * OSF1
  * SunOS
  * OS X versions prior to 10.3.
  * gcc on any platform prior to version 3.3

### Detailed Changes:

* Removed openexr.spec file, it's out of date and broken to boot.
 (Drew Hess)
          
* Support for Visual Studio 2005.  (Drew Hess, Nick Porcino)

* When compiling against OpenEXR headers on Windows, you no longer
  need to define any **HAVE_** or **PLATFORM_** macros in your
  projects.  If you are using any OpenEXR DLLs, however, you must
  define OPENEXR_DLL in your project's preprocessor directives.  (Drew
  Hess)

* Many fixes to the Windows VC7 build system.  (Drew Hess, Nick
  Porcino)

* Support for building universal binaries on OS X 10.4.  (Drew Hess,
Paul Schneider)
          
* Minor configure.ac fix to accomodate OS X's automake.  (Drew Hess)
          
* Removed CPU-specific optimizations from configure.ac, autoconf's
	  guess at the CPU type isn't very useful, anyway.  Closes
	  #13429.  (Drew Hess)
          
* Fixed quoting for tests in configure.ac.  Closes #13428.  (Drew
  Hess)
          
* Use host specification instead of target in configure.ac.  Closes
  #13427.  (Drew Hess)

* Fix use of AC_ARG_ENABLE in configure.ac.  Closes #13426.  (Drew
Hess)

* Removed workaround for OS X istream::read bug.  (Drew Hess)
          
* Added pthread support to OpenEXR pkg-config file.  (Drew Hess)
          
* Added -no-undefined to LDFLAGS and required libs to LIBADD for
  library projects with other library dependencies, per Rex Dieter's
  patch.  (Drew Hess)
          
* **HAVE_** macros are now defined in the OpenEXRConfig.h header file
  instead of via compiler flags.  There are a handful of public
  headers which rely on the value of these macros, and projects
  including these headers have previously needed to define the same
  macros and values as used by OpenEXR's 'configure', which is bad
  form.  Now 'configure' writes these values to the OpenEXRConfig.h
  header file, which is included by any OpenEXR source files that need
  these macros.  This method of specifying **HAVE_** macros guarantees
  that projects will get the proper settings without needing to add
  compile- time flags to accomodate OpenEXR.  Note that this isn't
  implemented properly for Windows yet.  (Drew Hess)

* Platform cleanups:

  - No more support for IRIX or OSF1.

  - No more explicit support for SunOS, because we have no way to
    verify that it's working.  I suspect that newish versions of SunOS
    will just work out of the box, but let me know if not.

  - No more **PLATFORM_** macros (vestiges of the ILM internal build
    system).  PLATFORM_DARWIN_PPC is replaced by HAVE_DARWIN.
    PLATFORM_REDHAT_IA32 (which was only used in IlmImfTest) is
    replaced by HAVE_LINUX_PROCFS.

  - OS X 10.4, which is the minimum version we're going to support
    with this version, appears to have support for nrand48 and
    friends, so no need to use the Imath-supplied version of them
    anymore.  (Drew Hess)

* No more PLATFORM_WINDOWS or PLATFORM_WIN32, replace with proper
  standard Windows macros.  (Drew Hess)

* Remove support for gcc 2.95, no longer supported.  (Drew Hess)

* Eliminate HAVE_IOS_BASE macro, OpenEXR now requires support for
  ios_base.  (Drew Hess)

* Eliminate HAVE_STL_LIMITS macro, OpenEXR now requires the ISO C++
  <limits> header.  (Drew Hess)

* Use double quote-style include dirctives for OpenEXR
  includes.  (Drew Hess)

* Added a document that gives an overview of the on-disk
  layout of OpenEXR files (Florian Kainz)

* Added sections on layers and on memory-mapped file input
  to the documentation.  (Florian Kainz)

* Bug fix: reading an incomplete file causes a deadlock while
  waiting on a semaphore.  (Florian Kainz)

* Updated documentation (ReadingAndWritingImageFiles.sxw) and sample
  code (IlmImfExamples): Added a section about multi-threading,
  updated section on thread-safety, changed documentation and sample
  code to use readTiles()/writeTiles() instead of
  readTile()/writeTile() where possible, mentioned that environment
  maps contain redundant pixels, updated section on testing if a file
  is an OpenEXR file.  (Florian Kainz)

* Multi-threading bug fixes (exceptions could be thrown multiple
  times, some operations were not thread safe), updated some comments,
  added comments, more multithreaded testing.  (Florian Kainz)

* Added multi-threading support: multiple threads
  cooperate to read or write a single OpenEXR file.
  (Wojciech Jarosz)

* Added operator== and operator!= to Imath::Frustum. (Andre Mazzone)

* Bug fix: Reading a PIZ-compressed file with an invalid Huffman code
  table caused crashes by indexing off the end of an array.  (Florian
  Kainz)

## Version 1.2.2 (March 15, 2005)

This is a relatively minor update to the project, with the following changes:

* New build system for Windows; support for DLLs.

* Switched documentation from HTML to PDF format.

* IlmImf: support for image layers in ChannelList.

* IlmImf: added isComplete() method to file classes to check whether a file is complete.

* IlmImf: exposed staticInitialize() in ImfHeader.h in order to allow
  thread-safe library initialization in multithreaded applications.

* IlmImf: New "time code" standard attribute.

* exrdisplay: support for displaying wrap-around texture map images.

* exrmaketiled: can now specify wrap mode.

* IlmImf: New "wrapmodes" standard attribute to indicate extrapolation
  mode for mipmaps and ripmaps.

* IlmImf: New "key code" standard attribute to identify motion picture
  film frames.

* Imath: Removed TMatrix<T> classes; these classes are still under
  development and are too difficult to keep in sync with OpenEXR CVS.

### Detailed Changes:


* Updated README to remove option for building with Visual C++ 6.0.
	  (Drew Hess)

* Some older versions of gcc don't support a full iomanip
	  implemenation; check for this during configuration. 
	  (Drew Hess)

* Install PDF versions of documentation, remove old/out-of-date
	  HTML documentation.  (Florian Kainz)

* Removed vc/vc6 directory; Visual C++ 6.0 is no longer
	  supported.  (Drew Hess)

* Updated README.win32 with details of new build system.
	  (Florian Kainz, Drew Hess)

* New build system for Windows / Visual C++ 7 builds both
	  static libraries and DLLs.
	  (Nick Porcino)

* Removed Imath::TMatrix<T> and related classes, which are not
	  used anywhere in OpenEXR.
	  (Florian Kainz)

* Added minimal support for "image layers" to class Imf::ChannelList
	  (Florian Kainz)

* Added new isComplete() method to InputFile, TiledInputFile
	  etc., that checks if a file is complete or if any pixels
	  are missing (for example, because writing the file was
	  aborted prematurely).
	  (Florian Kainz)

* Exposed staticInitialize() function in ImfHeader.h in order
	  to allow thread-safe library initialization in multithreaded
	  programs.
	  (Florian Kainz)

* Added a new "time code" attribute
	  (Florian Kainz)

* exrmaketiled: when a MIPMAP_LEVELS or RIPMAP_LEVELS image
	  is produced, low-pass filtering takes samples outside the
	  image's data window.  This requires extrapolating the image.
	  The user can now specify how the image is extrapolated
	  horizontally and vertically (image is surrounded by black /
	  outermost row of pixels repeats / entire image repeats /
	  entire image repeats, every other copy is a mirror image).
	  exrdisplay: added option to swap the top and botton half,
	  and the left and right half of an image, so that the image's
	  four corners end up in the center.  This is useful for checking
	  the seams of wrap-around texture map images.
	  IlmImf library: Added new "wrapmodes" standard attribute
	  to indicate the extrapolation mode for MIPMAP_LEVELS and
	  RIPMAP_LEVELS images.
	  (Florian Kainz)

* Added a new "key code" attribute to identify motion picture
	  film frames.
	  (Florian Kainz)

* Removed #include <Iex.h> from ImfAttribute.h, ImfHeader.h
	  and ImfXdr.h so that including header files such as
	  ImfInputFile.h no longer defines ASSERT and THROW macros,
	  which may conflict with similar macros defined by
	  application programs.
	  (Florian Kainz)

* Converted HTML documentation to OpenOffice format to
	  make maintaining the documents easier:
	      api.html -> ReadingAndWritingImageFiles.sxw
	      details.html -> TechnicalIntroduction.sxw
	  (Florian Kainz)

## Version 1.2.1 (June 6, 2004)

This is a fairly minor release, mostly just a few tweaks, a few bug
fixes, and some new documentation. Here are the most important
changes:

* reduced memory footprint of exrenvmap and exrmaketiled utilities.

* IlmImf: new helper functions to determine whether a file is an OpenEXR file, and whether it's scanline- or tile-based.

* IlmImf: bug fix for PXR24 compression with ySampling != 1.

* Better support for gcc 3.4.

* Warning cleanups in Visual C++.

### Detailed Changes:

* exrenvmap and exrmaketiled use slightly less memory
	  (Florian Kainz)

* Added functions to IlmImf for quickly testing if a file
	  is an OpenEXR file, and whether the file is scan-line
	  based or tiled. (Florian Kainz)

* Added preview image examples to IlmImfExamples.  Added
	  description of preview images and environment maps to
	  docs/api.html (Florian Kainz)

* Bug fix: PXR24 compression did not work properly for channels
	  with ySampling != 1.
	  (Florian Kainz)

* Made ``template <class T>`` become ``template <class S, class T>`` for 
          the ``transform(ObjectS, ObjectT)`` methods. This was done to allow
          for differing templated objects to be passed in e.g.  say a 
          ``Box<Vec3<S>>`` and a ``Matrix44<T>``, where S=float and T=double.
          (Jeff Yost, Arkell Rasiah)

* New method Matrix44::setTheMatrix(). Used for assigning a 
          M44f to a M44d. (Jeff Yost, Arkell Rasiah)

* Added convenience Color typedefs for half versions of Color3
          and Color4. Note the Makefile.am for both Imath and ImathTest
          have been updated with -I and/or -L pathing to Half.
          (Max Chen, Arkell Rasiah)

* Methods equalWithAbsError() and equalWithRelError() are now
          declared as const. (Colette Mullenhoff, Arkell Rasiah)

* Fixes for gcc34. Mainly typename/template/using/this syntax
          correctness changes. (Nick Ramussen, Arkell Rasiah)

* Added Custom low-level file I/O examples to IlmImfExamples
	  and to the docs/api.html document.  (Florian Kainz)

* Eliminated most warnings messages when OpenEXR is compiled
	  with Visual C++.  The OpenEXR code uses lots of (intentional
	  and unintended) implicit type conversions.  By default, Visual
	  C++ warns about almost all of them.  Most implicit conversions
	  have been removed from the .h files, so that including them
	  should not generate warnings even at warning level 3.  Most
	  .cpp files are now compiled with warning level 1.
	  (Florian Kainz)

## Version 1.2.0 (May 11, 2004)

OpenEXR 1.2.0 is now available. This is the first official,
production-ready release since OpenEXR 1.0.7. If you have been using
the development 1.1 series, please switch to 1.2.0 as soon as
possible. We believe that OpenEXR 1.2.0 is ready for use in shipping
applications. We have been using it in production at ILM for several
months now with no problems. There are quite a few major new features
in the 1.2 series as compared to the original 1.0 series:

* Support for tiled images, including mipmaps and ripmaps. Note that
  software based on the 1.0 series cannot read or write tiled
  images. However, simply by recompiling your software against the 1.2
  release, any code that reads scanline images can read tiled images,
  too.

* A new Pxr24 compressor, contributed by Pixar Animation
  Studios. Values produced by the Pxr24 compressor provide the same
  range as 32-bit floating-point numbers with slightly less precision,
  and compress quite a bit better. The Pxr24 compressor stores UINT
  and HALF channels losslessly, and for these data types performs
  similarly to the ZIP compressor.

* OpenEXR now supports high dynamic-range YCA (luminance/chroma/alpha)
  images with subsampled chroma channels. These files are supported
  via the RGBA convenience interface, so that data is presented to the
  application as RGB(A) but stored in the file as YC(A). OpenEXR also
  supports Y and YA (black-and-white/black-and-white with alpha)
  images.

* An abstracted file I/O interface, so that you can use OpenEXR with
  interfaces other than C++'s iostreams.

* Several new utilities for manipulating tiled image files.

### Detailed Changes:

* Production-ready release.

* Disable long double warnings on OS X.  (Drew Hess)

* Add new source files to VC7 IlmImfDll target.  (Drew Hess)

* Iex: change the way that APPEND_EXC and REPLACE_EXC modify
	  their what() string to work around an issue with Visual C++
	  7.1.  (Florian Kainz, Nick Porcino)

* Bumped OpenEXR version to 1.2 and .so versions to 2.0.0 in
	  preparation for the release.  (Drew Hess)

* Imath: fixed ImathTMatrix.h to work with gcc 3.4.  (Drew Hess)

* Another quoting fix in openexr.m4.  (Drew Hess)

* Quoting fix in acinclude.m4 for automake 1.8.  (Brad Hards)

* Imath: put inline at beginning of declaration in ImathMatrix.h
	  to fix a warning.  (Ken McGaugh)

* Imath: made Vec equalWithError () methods const.

* Cleaned up compile-time Win32 support.  (Florian Kainz)

* Bug fix: Reading a particular broken PIZ-compressed file
	  caused crashes by indexing off the end of an array.
	  (Florian Kainz)

## Version 1.1.1 (March 27, 2004)

OpenEXR 1.1.1 is now available. This another development release. We
expect to release a stable version, 1.2, around the end of
April. Version 1.1.1 includes support for PXR24 compression, and for
high-dynamic-range luminance/chroma images with subsampled chroma
channels. Version 1.1.1 also fixes a bug in the 1.1.0 tiled file
format.

### Detailed Changes:

* Half: operator= and variants now return by reference rather
	  than by value.  This brings half into conformance with
	  built-in types.  (Drew Hess)

* Half: remove copy constructor, let compiler supply its
	  own.  This improves performance up to 25% on some
	  expressions using half.  (Drew Hess)

* configure: don't try to be fancy with CXXFLAGS, just use
	  what the user supplies or let configure choose a sensible
	  default if CXXFLAGS is not defined.

* IlmImf: fixed a bug in reading scanline files on big-endian
          architectures.  (Drew Hess)

* exrmaketiled: Added an option to select compression type.
	  (Florian Kainz)

* exrenvmap: Added an option to select compression type.
	  (Florian Kainz)

* exrdisplay: Added some new command-line options.  (Florian Kainz)

* IlmImf: Added Pixar's new "slightly lossy" image compression
	  method.  The new method, named PXR24, preserves HALF and
	  UINT data without loss, but FLOAT pixels are converted to
	  a 24-bit representation.  PXR24 appears to compress
	  FLOAT depth buffers very well without losing much accuracy.
	  (Loren Carpenter, Florian Kainz)

* Changed top-level LICENSE file to allow for other copyright
	  holders for individual files.

* IlmImf: TILED FILE FORMAT CHANGE.  TiledOutputFile was
	  incorrectly interleaving channels and scanlines before
	  passing pixel data to a compressor.  The lossless compressors
	  still work, but lossy compressors do not.  Fix the bug by
	  interleaving channels and scanlines in tiled files in the
	  same way as ScanLineOutputFile does.  Programs compiled with
	  the new version of IlmImf cannot read tiled images produced
	  with version 1.1.0.  (Florian Kainz)

* IlmImf: ImfXdr.h fix for 64-bit architectures.  (Florian Kainz)

* IlmImf: OpenEXR now supports YCA (luminance/chroma/alpha)
	  images with subsampled chroma channels.  When an image
	  is written with the RGBA convenience interface, selecting
	  WRITE_YCA instead of WRITE_RGBA causes the library to
	  convert the pixels to YCA format.  If WRITE_Y is selected,
	  only luminance is stored in the file (for black and white
	  images).  When an image file is read with the RGBA convenience
	  interface, YCA data are automatically converted back to RGBA.
	  (Florian Kainz)

* IlmImf: speed up reading tiled files as scan lines.
	  (Florian Kainz)

* Half:  Fixed subtle bug in Half where signaling float NaNs
	  were being converted to inf in half.  (Florian Kainz)

* gcc 3.3 compiler warning cleanups.  (various)

* Imath: ImathEuler.h fixes for gcc 3.4.  (Garrick Meeker)
	
## Version 1.1.0 (February 6, 2004)

 OpenEXR 1.1.0 is now available. This is a major new release with
 support for tiled images, multi-resolution files (mip/ripmaps),
 environment maps, and abstracted file I/O. We've also released a new
 set of images that demonstrate these features, and updated the
 CodeWarrior project and Photoshop plugins for this release. See the
 downloads section for the source code and the new images.

## Detailed Changes:

* Added new targets to Visual C++ .NET 2003 project
	  for exrmaketiled, exrenvmap, exrmakepreview, and exrstdattr.
	  (Drew Hess)

* A few assorted Win32 fixes for Imath.  (Drew Hess)

* GNU autoconf builds now produce versioned libraries.
	  This release is 1:0:0.  (Drew Hess)

* Fixes for Visual C++ .NET 2003.  (Paul Schneider)

* Updated Visual C++ zlib project file to zlib 1.2.1.
	  (Drew Hess)

* exrdisplay: Fixed fragment shader version.  (Drew Hess)

* *Test: Fixed some compiler issues.  (Drew Hess)

* Imath: Handle "restrict" keyword properly.  (Drew Hess)

* IlmImfExamples: Updated to latest versions of example
	  source code, includes tiling and multi-res images.
	  (Florian Kainz)

* exrmakepreview: A new utility to create preview images.
	  (Florian Kainz)

* exrenvmap: A new utility to create OpenEXR environment
	  maps.  (Florian Kainz)

* exrstdattr: A new utility to modify standard 
	  attributes.  (Florian Kainz)

* Updated exrheader to print level rounding mode and
	  preview image size.  (Florian Kainz)

* Updated exrmaketiled to use level rounding mode.
	  (Florian Kainz)

* IlmImf: Changed the orientation of lat-long envmaps to
	  match typical panoramic camera setups.  (Florian Kainz)

* IlmImf: Fixed a bug where partially-completed files with
	  DECREASING_Y could not be read.  (Florian Kainz)

* IlmImf: Added support for selectable rounding mode (up/down)
	  when generating multiresolution files.  (Florian Kainz)

* exrdisplay: Support for tiled images, mip/ripmaps, preview
	  images, and display windows.  (Florian Kainz, Drew Hess)

* exrmaketiled: A new utility which generates tiled
	  versions of OpenEXR images.  (Florian Kainz)

* IlmImf: Changed Imf::VERSION to Imf::EXR_VERSION to
	  work around problems with autoconf VERSION macro
	  conflict.  (Drew Hess)

* exrheader: Support for tiles, mipmaps, environment
	  maps.  (Florian Kainz)

* IlmImf: Environment map support.  (Florian Kainz)

* IlmImf: Abstracted stream I/O support.  (Florian Kainz)

* IlmImf: Support for tiled and mip/ripmapped files;
	  requires new file format.  (Wojciech Jarosz, Florian Kainz)

* Imath: **TMatrix**, generic 2D matricies and algorithms.
	  (Francesco Callari)

* Imath: major quaternions cleanup.  (Cary Phillips)

* Imath: added GLBegin, GLPushAttrib, GLPushMatrix objects
	  for automatic cleanup on exceptions.  (Cary Phillips)

* Imath: removed implicit scalar->vector promotions and vector
	  comparisons.  (Nick Rasmussen)
	
## Version 1.0.7 (January 7, 2004)

OpenEXR 1.0.7 is now available. In addition to some bug fixes, this
version adds support for some new standard attributes, such as primary
and white point chromaticities, lens aperture, film speed, image
acquisition time and place, and more. If you want to use these new
attributes in your applications, see the ImfStandardAttributes.h
header file for documentation.

Our project hosting site, Savannah, is still recovering from a
compromise last month, so in the meantime, we're hosting file
downloads here. Some of the files are not currently available, but
we're working to restore them.

### Detailed Changes:

* Fixed a typo in one of the IlmImfTest tests. (Paul Schneider)

* Fixed a bug in exrdisplay that causes the image to display
	  as all black if there's a NaN or infinity in an OpenEXR
	  image. (Florian Kainz)

* Updated exrheader per recent changes to IlmImf library.
	  (Florian Kainz)

* Changed an errant float to a T in ImathFrame.h nextFrame().
	  (Cary Phillips)

* Support for new "optional standard" attributes
	  (chromaticities, luminance, comments, etc.).
	  (Florian Kainz, Greg Ward, Joseph Goldstone)

* Fixed a buffer overrun in ImfOpaqueAttribute. (Paul Schneider)

* Added new function, isImfMagic (). (Florian Kainz)
	
## Version 1.0.6:

	  extractSHRT now takes an additional optional
          argument, see ImathMatrixAlgo.h for details.  (Various)

* Added Wojciech Jarosz to AUTHORS file.

* Added test cases for uncompressed case, preview images,
	  frame buffer type conversion.  (Wojciech Jarosz,
	  Florian Kainz)

* Fix a bug in IlmImf where uncompressed data doesn't get
	  read/written correctly.  (Wojciech Jarosz)

* Added support for preview images and preview image
	  attributes (thumbnail images) in IlmImf.  (Florian Kainz)

* Added support for automatic frame buffer type conversion
	  in IlmImf.  (Florian Kainz)

* Cleaned up some compile-time checks.

* Added HalfTest unit tests.

* [exrdisplay] Download half framebuffer to texture memory 
	  instead of converting to float first.  Requires latest
	  Nvidia drivers.

## Version 1.0.5 (April 3, 2003)

Industrial Light & Magic has released the source code for an OpenEXR
display driver for Pixar's Renderman. This display driver is covered
under the OpenEXR free software license. See the downloads section for
the source code.

### Detailed Changes:

* Fixed IlmImf.dll to use static runtime libs (Andreas).

* Added exrheader project to Visual Studio 6.0 workspace.

* Added some example code showing how to use the IlmImf library.
	  (Florian)

* Use DLL runtime libs for Win32 libraries rather than static
	  runtime libs.

	  workspace to enable fragment shaders in Win32.

* Add an IlmImfDll project to the Visual Studio 6.0 workspace.

* In Win32, export the ImfCRgbaFile C interface via a DLL so
	  that Visual C++ 6.0 users can link against an Intel-compiled
	  IlmImf.  (Andreas Kahler)

* Use auto_ptr in ImfAutoArray on Win32, it doesn't like large 
	  automatic stacks.

* Performance improvements in PIZ decoding, between
	  20 and 60% speedup on Athlon and Pentium 4 systems.
          (Florian)

* Updated ImfDoubleAttribute.h for Codewarrior on MacOS.

* Added exrheader utility.

* Update to AUTHORS file.

* Added a README.win32 file.

* Added project files for Visual Studio 6.0.

* Initial Win32 port.  Requires Visual Studio 6.0 and Intel C++
	  compiler version 7.0.

* Fixed some bugs in ImathQuat.h

* Proper use of fltk-config to get platform-specific FLTK
	  compile- and link-time flags.

* exrdisplay uses Imath::Math<T>::pow instead of powf now.
	  powf is not availble on all platforms.

* Roll OS X "hack" into the source until Apple fixes their
	  istream implementation.
	
## Version 1.0.4

### Detailed Changes:

* OpenEXR is now covered by a modified BSD license.  See LICENSE
	  for the new terms.

	  ImathTest to check this case.

* Install include files when 'make install' is run.

* exrdisplay requires fltk 1.1+ now in an effort to support
	  a MacOS X display program (fltk 1.1 runs on OS X), though this
	  is untested.

* renamed configure.in to configure.ac

* Removed some tests from IexTest that are no longer used.

* Removed ImfHalfXdr.h, it's not used anymore.

* Revamped the autoconf system, added some compile-time
